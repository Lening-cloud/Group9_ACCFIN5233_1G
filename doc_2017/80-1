The Republican tax plan, which passed Congress Wednesday, 
âCongress, working closely with the President, took a monumental step to bring taxes paid by U.S. businesses in line with the rest of the industrialized world,â said Randall Stephenson, AT&T chairman and CEO. âThis tax reform will drive economic growth and create good-paying jobs. In fact, we will increase our U.S. investment and pay a special bonus to our U.S. employees.â
At a news conference Wednesday, President Trump cited AT&Tâs move.
âFifth Third Bancorp will pay more than 13,500 employees a bonus and raise the minimum wage of its workforce to $15 an hour after the passage of the Republican tax plan that will cut the bankâs corporate tax rate...Nearly 3,000 workers will see hourly wages rise to $15. The $1,000 one-time bonus is expected to be paid by the end of this year.
âWells Fargo, meanwhile, also said it would be boosting its minimum wage for employees to $15 an hour, which was prompted by the tax plan. The San Francisco-based bank also said it would target $400 million in donations to community and nonprofit organizations next year.â

â¢ In being classified as a transport service instead of an online platform, Uber must comply with local rules that govern taxis.
â¢ It doesnât block Uber from operating in any countries where the company currently operates.
â¢ But it doesnât let Uber move forward with any so-called peer-to-peer services in which anyone with a driverâs license and a car can use its app to pick up customers.

The ruling is expected to set a precedent for how Uber will be allowed to operate across the E.U., including in a separate pending case at Europeâs highest court involving a complaint by a French taxi association against Uber. A decision in that case is expected sometime next year, and it will likely cement demands that the ride-booking company comply with Europeâs transport standards.

A service that connects, by means of mobile telephone software, potential passengers with drivers offering individual urban transport on demand, where the provider of the service exerts control over the key conditions governing the supply of transport made within that context, in particular the price, does not constitute an information society service within the meaning of those provisions.
No. But hereâs what a representative for the company said:
This ruling will not change things in most E.U. countries where we already operate under transportation law. However, millions of Europeans are still prevented from using apps like ours. As our new C.E.O. has said, it is appropriate to regulate services such as Uber and so we will continue the dialogue with cities across Europe

When Dara Khosrowshahi took the helm of Uber in September, the former Expedia chief said he was leaning against hiring a C.O.O., 
Khosrowshahiâs first few months on the job convinced him that he had to take a different role than the one he played at Expedia. Uber required a CEO who was more a public face of the company. Khosrowshahi was meeting with regulators in London who had revoked Uberâs license when he had to work with the board of directors over a deal for SoftBank Group Corp. to invest in the company. Later, he visited Brazil to win over lawmakers there.
Mr. Harford is the second big hire of Mr. Khosrowshahi, who is putting his stamp on the company. In October, he appointed Tony West as chief legal officer. Mr. West had been general counsel at PepsiCo. Uber still needs to name a chief financial officer.
Mr. Harford is someone that Mr. Khosrowshahi is familiar with, having worked and competed with him over the past decade-plus.
â¢ Mr. Harford was an executive at Expedia when Mr. Khosrowshahi became C.E.O. of the company in 2005.
â¢ The pair then competed when Mr. Harford was named C.E.O. at Orbitz, one of Expediaâs main rivals, in 2009.
â¢ In 2015, Mr. Harford sold Orbitz to Expedia for $1.6 billion.

âIf tax reform is enacted, we expect our uses of cash from tax savings would include, optimizing CapEx to capture the benefits of 100% expensing to further grow the business and create even more upward mobility for our team members.
âFunding our pension plans beyond our current forecast. Increasing the dividend as our board may approve. Continuing our stock repurchase program at our current modest levels, and investing in M&A where it makes sense.
âU.S. GDP could increase materially next year as a result of U.S. tax reform. If this occurs, we would likely increase capital expenditures and hiring to accommodate the additional volumes triggered from this incremental GDP growth.â
His comments break somewhat from the narrative that has developed around the Republican tax overhaul. Proponents of the bill argue that cutting the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent will lead corporate America to invest more in their businesses and hire more workers. Critics counter that companies will spend their cash windfall on share buybacks and dividends, not on growing their businesses.
The latter argument gained more traction last month at The Wall Street Journalâs C.E.O. conference. During a discussion with Gary Cohn, President Trumpâs chief economic adviser, a moderator asked the chief executives in attendance whether they planned to increase their capital expenditures if the G.O.P. plan was enacted. 
âWhy arenât the other hands up?â Mr. Cohn asked.

Hereâs what Hank Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, emailed us about the billâs passing:
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be a major breakthrough for Americaâs long-term competitiveness and prosperity. For decades, American workers have been paying the price for our archaic corporate tax system. The reforms in this bill will enable Americaâs companies, which are our job creators, to be better engines of growth and prosperity, and it will attract job-creating investment in the U.S. by foreign companies.

HNAâs efforts to cut its enormous debt load has led to some unintended â and probably unwelcome â consequences. Namely, that one of its portfolio companies now counts a major activist investor among its shareholders.
How Elliott gained its stake in the duty-free retailer Dufry is pretty complicated, as Robert Smith of the FT 
Elliott was able to get hold of the stock because HNA recently took out a so-called âequity collarâ facility, under which it lent a stake in the Swiss company to a bank in exchange for funding. This collar facility allows the Chinese company to remain a shareholder on paper even though it no longer directly holds the shares. But the bank that provided the collar sold the underlying Dufry stake to funds, including Elliott, to hedge its position, according to the people familiar with the matter.

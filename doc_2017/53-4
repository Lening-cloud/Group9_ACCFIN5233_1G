As the Trump administration moves to block one media deal, it appears more supportive of today’s big transaction.
From 
President Donald Trump called Rupert Murdoch on Thursday and congratulated him ahead of a deal for Walt Disney Co. to buy some of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox Inc., White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.
“I know that the president spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal,” Sanders said.
Ms. Sanders also inserted the White House into the little matter of 
There’s a problem. Here’s what Disney’s C.F.O., Christine McCarthy, told analysts this morning:
We expect to fully realize roughly $2 billion of cost synergies by 2021.
As Andrew reminded earlier this week, “synergies” is a code word for “layoffs.” And Disney executives said that the company expects to start realizing synergies within the first year after the deal closes.
It isn’t clear yet how many jobs would be cut if the transaction succeeds, but this would be a rare deal if it actually generated new positions on balance.
Fox has a bit of unfinished business before it can go forward with its deal with Disney.
It’s in the process of seeking regulatory approval in Britain to take full control of the British satellite television giant Sky in a deal worth about $15 billion. The two companies said on Thursday that Fox plans to proceed with the acquisition and hopes to complete the acquisition of the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn’t own by the end of June.
Sky would then be wholly owned by Disney, following the closing of the Fox deal.
Mr. Murdoch’s company had previously said that its existing stake in Sky was “not a natural end position.”
In June, the regulator Ofcom ruled that Rupert Murdoch and other company executives were 
Britain’s culture minister, Karen Bradly, asked the country’s competition regulator in September to carry out 
As part of his company’s $52.4 billion deal for Fox, Bob Iger of Disney agreed to renew his contract through 2021 to help complete the merger and integrate the new businesses.
That would seem to mean a 2020 presidential run is off the table for Mr. Iger.
In March, 
The publication added:
Iger told THR in June that “a lot of people — a lot — have urged me to seek political office” but denied he would consider a run for California governor or senator, positions that historically have served as stepping stones to the White House. However, Iger didn’t specifically address the prospect of a White House run at the time.

That’s the question that media executives and Wall Street bankers have been asking this morning.
Could a digital company like Amazon, Google or Apple emerge with a higher bid? Or Verizon or Comcast?
Or could some of them team up to buy the assets and split them among themselves? For example, Comcast has always wanted Fox’s international assets, while any of the digital players would love to own Fox’s content business.
The Fox-Disney deal has about a $1.5 billion breakup fee if a higher bid were to emerge. If regulators block the deal, Disney would have to pay about $2.5 billion.
The Murdochs’ voting control is worth 39 percent of 21st Century Fox in most situations, except for this: If the company were up for sale, they can only vote their economic stake, which is about 17 percent. And of course, even if the deal is completed as presented today, the next chess piece that will become a point of focus is Hulu given its ownership: Disney would control 60 percent of the service, but Comcast would still own 30 percent and Time Warner owns another 10 percent.
It gets complicated quickly.

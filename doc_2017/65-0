But Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, said on Thursday that he would vote against the legislation unless it further expanded the child tax credit, which would drive up the billâs cost. Republicans have said little about how the bill would be paid for, other than agreeing to nudge up the corporate tax rate.

One was originally the first amendment on the list. It had nothing to do with freedom of speech or religion, but proposed 
The other came second, and dealt with congressional pay rather than the right to bear arms.
Neither was ratified by the states at the time, so only the remaining 10 became the Bill of Rights.
However, a loophole that placed no time limit on ratification â and the work of a determined university student â led to the original second amendment

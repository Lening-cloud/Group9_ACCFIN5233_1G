This week is supposed to be the official rollout of the planned tax overhaul led by President Trump and congressional Republicans. But news reports about possible first charges by Robert Mueller (first 
S. & P. futures were down this morning, perhaps because of the newest wrinkle in what was already a complicated legislative process for enacting tax cuts. Republicans still don’t seem to agree on what should be in the plan.

Meanwhile, the National Association of Home Builders has said that it cannot support the proposal in what appears to be its current form after Republicans said they wouldn’t accept the idea of replacing deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes with a new tax credit. (
And Democrats are attacking the current proposal as a “middle-class con job.” (
Based on Mr. Trump’s own pronouncement, we could learn this week his choice to lead the Federal Reserve. It’s still a guess as to whom the president will nominate — or even whether that nominee will share the White House zeal for financial deregulation.
Jerome H. Powell, who is said to be the front-runner, helped construct some of the current rules. If he is chosen, it may mean that the Trump administration believes it can loosen restrictions on Wall Street even without the enthusiastic support of a Fed chairman, according to 
That may throw up some obstacles to Mr. Powell’s confirmation by the Senate. More from Mr. Appelbaum’s article:
Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart executive chairman, said in a Friday night phone call to the president that he was going “off the chain” to destroy the hedge fund billionaire, according to 
What’s fascinating is the fault line between Mr. Bannon and his particular brand of nationalism, and Mr. Singer, who is considered a “globalist” — and has ties to Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.
But it’s unclear whether the White House will turn on Mr. Singer. Yes, the Elliott Management founder was an early backer of the “Never Trump” movement. But he has since signed onto the team of White House supporters, donating to Mr. Trump’s inauguration and providing money for the Republican tax overhaul campaign.

Shareholder activism, of a sort, appears to be brewing in the N.F.L. as well.
The controversy around player protests and other matters led Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys to discuss Mr. Goodell’s future as N.F.L. commissioner on a conference call with 16 other team owners last week, according to 
“You don’t get to have this many messes over the years like Roger has had and survive it,” one unidentified owner said on the call, according to ESPN.
• Remember that the N.F.L. is facing declining ratings (though James Murdoch of 21st Century Fox 
• Remember also that the N.F.L. is a business with $14 billion in sales. Revenue has tripled since Mr. Goodell became commissioner — and he has been rewarded for that, receiving roughly $150 million from 2007 through 2015, according to

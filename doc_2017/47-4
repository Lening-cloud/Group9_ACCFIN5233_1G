The Justice Department hasnât sued to block AT&Tâs $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner â not yet, anyway. But its antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has laid out the principles that would guide that lawsuit when, or if, it is filed.
Our colleague Cecilia Kang was on hand for Mr. Delrahimâs speech, delivered at the American Bar Associationâs Fall Forum. Here are the parts of the speech she found most important:
âLike any regulatory scheme, behavioral remedies require centralized decisions instead of a free market process. They also set static rules devoid of the dynamic realities of the market. With limited information, how can antitrust lawyers hope to write rules that distort competitive incentives just enough to undo the damage done by a merger, for years to come? I donât think Iâm smart enough to do that.â
âTo be clear, that cuts both waysâif a merger is illegal, we should only accept a clean and complete solution, but if the merger is legal we should 
Liberty Media Chairman John Malone 
â¢ âIf youâre in the B2C business, if youâre selling anything to any consumer anywhere on the planet, you gotta believe that Amazon is gonna have a look at that opportunity to commoditize you to use scale to serve the public,â Mr. Malone told CNBCâs David Faber during an interview at the Liberty Media annual investor meeting.
â¢ Mr. Malone also said that âitâs way too lateâ for the cable industry to compete with Netflix. âThe only outfit right now that has a chance of overtaking them would be Amazon.â
Now that Emerson has 
Hereâs what Emerson is offering now: $135 a share in cash and $90 worth of new Emerson shares for each Rockwell share. The new bid is about 60 percent cash, while the last offer was split evenly between cash and stock.
Rockwell shares are up nearly 5 percent, though at $197.51 they remain well below the new offer price, suggesting that investors remain wary a deal will get done. (Theyâre still at highs unseen in Rockwellâs history.) Emersonâs shares have rebounded Thursday, after initially dropping on news of the offer and now flat.
Now that Emerson has raised its offer for a third time, thereâs a question about which other levers are available to bring Rockwell to the negotiating table. It canât seek to unseat Rockwell directors â the deadline to nominate board members has already passed â so will Emerson bring its offer directly to shareholders?

It isnât clear what influence the Kochs would have should Meredith prevail, the NYT reports. But Charles and David Koch have been interested in media investments before, having explored a deal for the business now known as Tronc (including the L.A. Times and the Chicago Tribune) four years ago.
Peter Kafka of Recode says thereâs a case for this being 
So itâs possible the Kochs are making a purely economic bet here, and they believe a version of the pitch Time Inc.âs management has been making for years: Weâre going to use our declining print business to build a new digital business. (Time Inc.âs digital ad revenues passed $500 million last year â a number that Time Inc. execs like to compare to BuzzFeed, which did about half of that in the same time frame.)
Norwayâs trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund has proposed to its finance ministry dropping oil and gas companies from its benchmark index, 
The aim is to reduce the fundâs exposure to a drop in oil and gas prices. These holdings make up 6 percent or about $37 billion of the fundâs benchmark equity index.
âWhile the central bank said the view was not based on any prediction of future oil and gas commodity prices or the âsustainabilityâ of the sector, the move will be closely watched given the fundâs clout in global equity markets.â

Fake job interviews and undercover agents who formerly worked for the Israeli military. These are among the tools of trade used by Black Cube, the firm hired by Harvey Weinstein to look into the backgrounds of women who had accused him of sexual assault and harassment.

Earlier this month, a former hedge fund employee was flown from Hong Kong to London for a job interview. Around the same time, a current employee of the same Toronto hedge fund was also flown to London for interviews. The company courting them was fake. Its website was fake. There were no jobs to be had, and the woman who set up the interviews was not a recruiter but an agent working for an Israeli private investigative firm.

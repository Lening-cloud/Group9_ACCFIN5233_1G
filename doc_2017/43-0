The Treasury has also run a pilot project to collect on defaulted loans, a job which the Education Department contracts out. The experiment did not end well, failing to increase collection rates or help borrowers better understand their repayment options.

It is unclear whether environmental regulators will open investigations into G.M. and its emissions-control technology.

âHistorically speaking, and as a seasoned investor, Iâd say investors should just ignore geopolitical events like âBrexitâ or whatever is happening in Brazil.â

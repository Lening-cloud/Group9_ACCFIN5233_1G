Speaking to reporters today, 
The comment comes a day after 
The president has long criticized the deal. When the deal 
AT&T and Time Warner had trumpeted the competitive advantages the deal would bring in making their case to shareholders, 
Here’s a sampling from the Justice Department’s complaint:
As AT&T has expressly recognized, however, distributors that control popular programming “have the incentive and ability to use (and indeed have used whenever and wherever they can) that control as a weapon to hinder competition.”
As DirecTV has explained, such vertically integrated programmers “can much more credibly threaten to withhold programming from rival [distributors]” and can “use such threats to demand higher prices and more favorable terms.”
As AT&T/DirecTV’s strategic merger documents state, after the merger, disruption need not occur immediately—the merged firm can “operate [its] pay-TV business as a ‘cash cow’ while slowly pivoting to new models.”
As DirecTV itself has explained: “[V]ertical integration of programming and distribution can, if left unchecked, give the integrated entity the incentive and ability to gain an unfair advantage over its rivals. This ultimately results in higher prices and lower quality service for consumers.”
AT&T/DirecTV executives have concluded that the “runway” for the decline of traditional payTV “may be longer than some think given the economics of the space,” and that it is “upon us to utilize our assets to extend that runway.”
AT&T itself has previously stated that access to some of the most popular television programming is “critical to preserve and promote competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming.”
While the comments put AT&T in an uncomfortable position, 
“After reviewing DOJ’s lawsuit against AT&T-Time Warner and watching AT&T’s press conference, we still see a settlement as possible and, failing that, we believe AT&T would prevail in court.”
The Federal Communications Commission 
“Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,” F.C.C. chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. “Instead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate.”
The move is a win for the giant telecoms like AT&T and Verizon as well as the big cable providers such as Comcast.
“The losers could be internet sites that will have to answer telecom firms to get their content in front of consumers. And consumers may see their bills increase for the best quality of internet service.”
Andrew worked the phones yesterday and hears:
Media executives at the other big content and distribution providers privately tell me that they hope AT&T and Time Warner do not find a way to settle. They are confident that the companies will win in court and hope that would put pressure on the Justice Department as it examines future deals.
A Justice Department official told reporters yesterday that the regulator isn’t reflexively against “vertical” mergers, despite 
There’s a question of whether the Justice Department’s lawsuit would chill a 
As Michael Nathanson of the research firm Moffett Nathanson 
• Jennifer Saba and Gina Chon write of AT&T’s chief, Randall Stephenson, “Anything less than all-out victory this time would be fatal.” (
• Ken Brown writes, “The flaw in Wall Street’s thinking was that precedent would hold in an administration that doesn’t highly value precedent.” (
• Tara Lachapelle writes, “Both Time Warner and AT&T have plunged as the U.S. Justice Department tries to stop their merger, but AT&T needs the deal far more because it’s the linchpin of its video strategy.” (
The telecommunications giant and its peers have lobbied hard against the Obama administration’s efforts to prevent broadband providers from charging higher fees to access particular websites or online services like Netflix. Now the F.C.C. under Chairman Ajit Pai is poised to roll those initiatives back.

Mr. Pai plans to accompany the repeal of net neutrality with several other measures that will also benefit broadband companies, said the people with knowledge of the matter. That includes suggesting that the Federal Trade Commission, which has traditionally not brought many cases, be the enforcement agency of net neutrality violations, they said.

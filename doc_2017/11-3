The election in France on Sunday, pitting an independent centrist against a far-right nationalist, could signal the end of the âEuropean experiment,â lead to a â
All that stands between the world and the unknown, the British and American news media have said frequently in recent days, are the polls predicting the outcome of the French election.
And so, again, we find ourselves awaiting an important election and poring over the numerical tea leaves.
But can we really trust polls? Remember what they said about the likelihood of a President Trump? Remember âBrexitâ? Remember arguing about pollsters who relied too much on calls to voters with landlines? Remember screaming into the void: âWho still has a landline?â

For now, however, populism does not seem to be sweeping Europe or upending the status quo. Europe was similarly on edge before votes in Austria and the Netherlands, where nationalist candidates won in early rounds of voting but lost in the end â just as the polls predicted.
While the news media is apt to blame pollsters for getting important elections wrong, the pollsters are just as likely to blame the news media.
Many pollsters, including Professor Durand, insist that the news media does not adequately explain the margin of error to voters, giving the impression that even a single-digit lead represents an inevitable victory.
âWithout an explanation,â she said, âthose numbers are meaningless.â

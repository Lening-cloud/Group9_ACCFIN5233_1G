Russia is Topic A in the Senate today, especially with lawyers for Facebook, Google and Twitter set to testify before the Judiciary Committee. We expect Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee chairman, and other members to ask hard questions about:
• When the tech giants knew the full extent of Russia’s interference with the 2016 election
• What they intend to do to stop that from happening again — a tricky job for companies seeking to both preserve free speech and ward off further regulation.

Let’s face it: Despite the impending tax plan rollout and the picking of a nominee for Federal Reserve chairman, Washington will still be largely talking about the criminal charges that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates face in Robert Mueller’s investigation.
Some of those conversations will concern Tom Barrack, one of President Trump’s closest advisers, who has emerged as connected to the two men. Could that see him pushed out of the White House inner circle?
Mr. Barrack had helped persuade Mr. Trump to hire Mr. Manafort (an acquaintance of both men) as campaign manager last summer, according to 
Mr. Barrack’s Colony NorthStar fired Mr. Gates as an adviser after Monday’s indictments, according to Erik Schatzker of 
We’re a day away from the House formally unveiling its version of the Republican tax overhaul — and there’s still disagreement about what should be in the package.
The latest question is whether the corporate tax rate should go down to 20 percent from 35 percent immediately or in stages.
House negotiators are considering a phased reduction, according to Jennifer Jacobs and Anna Edgerton of 
• Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said that she opposed a decrease in the tax rate for those making more than $1 million a year and elimination the estate tax. (
• The Senate’s version of the tax plan is likely to maintain some lesser version of the estate tax but it may also at least partly repeal deductions for state and local taxes, according to unidentified people. That could endanger support from senators in high-tax districts. (
• Remember that Republicans can’t lose more than two senators to pass the tax legislation without Democratic votes.
Few will be surprised — unless Mr. Trump changes his mind at the last minute. Barring that, the announcement could come as soon as Thursday, after the Fed wraps up its policy meeting, according to Maggie Haberman and Binyamin Appelbaum of

Paul McCulley, the former chief economist at Pimco, says he’s still a fan of Ms. Yellen as Fed chairwoman. “Yellen would be an inspired choice: She resolutely believes in the Fed’s dual mandate to pursue maximum employment in the context of low and stable inflation,” he writes in

The question is whether SoftBank really intends to walk away. We’ve heard that the Japanese conglomerate’s board is unhappy with the prospect of losing control in a merger: At a board meeting last Friday, several directors questioned whether it was wise to take only about 40 percent of the combined wireless business — a smaller amount than Deutsche Telekom — because T-Mobile is currently bigger than Sprint.
We’ve seen hardball negotiating tactics from SoftBank and Masayoshi Son before: The Japanese conglomerate expressed interest in buying the cable company Charter Communications earlier this year before resuming talks with T-Mobile.

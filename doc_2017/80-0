It took Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tiebreaking vote that struck down the ability of Americans to file class-action lawsuits against financial institutions. But Republicans had long opposed the move against arbitration clauses that had been proposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that it would have led to frivolous lawsuits and driven up credit card interest rates.

The Hudson’s Bay Company, which owns both retailers, has absolutely no intention of selling even a piece of Saks’s famed Fifth Avenue store, as it did with Lord & Taylor’s flagship building. “The Saks store is way too productive in the luxury retail business to handle any other uses,” Richard Baker, the C.E.O. of Hudson’s Bay,

In the waning days of the Obama administration, Prime Minister Theresa May tossed a grenade into the special relationship between the United States and Britain when she decided to fiercely criticize Secretary of State John Kerry’s efforts for a two-state solution in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
With a ready-made role model in Margaret Thatcher, the first woman to serve as Britain’s prime minister, will Mrs. May — as Mrs. Thatcher did so effectively with President Ronald Reagan — work with President-elect Donald Trump to fashion a new global order?
No doubt Mrs. Thatcher would have backed Mr. Trump for his hard-right ideology, and Mrs. May’s recent remarks bode ominously for the continued American-British collaboration with respect to the Middle East.
Mrs. Thatcher was famous for her disregard for diplomatic niceties and for refusing to back down. It would be disastrous, and not just for the special relationship, if Mrs. May continues to follow Mr. Trump down this path of no return.

Right from the start, the British election was all about the unexpected: Prime Minister Theresa May 
Mrs. May said she needed a bigger majority for her Conservative Party in Parliament to bolster her hand during negotiations with the European Union over Britain’s exit, known as Brexit, and initial polls suggested that she was well positioned to get what she wanted.
Instead, her campaign began to falter. Mrs. May said that she alone could lead a “strong and stable” Britain, but her missteps led some critics to describe her as “weak and wobbly.”
At the same time, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour chief who was once seen as too far left to be a credible leader, found his footing on the campaign trail and staged a resurgence.

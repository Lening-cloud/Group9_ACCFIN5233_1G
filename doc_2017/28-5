This image resembled nothing more than âThe Rhodes Colossus,â a famous jingoistic cartoon from 1892 in which the racist, empire-building diamond tycoon Cecil Rhodes stood similarly astride Africa, from Cairo to Cape Town. âWeâll walk away from a bad deal â and make E.U. pay,â read the text beside the illustration, as if the Lord Kitchener Wants You poster had been blessed with the eloquence of Mrs. Mayâs new best friend, Donald J. Trump.
But was she 
Sober analysts agree that Mrs. Mayâs plans are deeply foolish. Her intention is to sacrifice Britainâs membership in the European single market, something necessary for the economy to function as it is now configured, to gain full control over immigration policy, which is not. In short, she is planning to profoundly alienate key industries and trading partners to score populist popularity points.
Parliament will be afforded little oversight in relation to the process and frankly doesnât seem interested in opposing it, no matter how extreme Mrs. Mayâs plans are. The House of Commons 
All this domestic turmoil is indicative of the way in which Brexit goes to the heart of Britainâs national identity. For this reason, it is hard to believe that the jingoistic associations of The Daily Mailâs cartoon were a coincidence. Brexit is rooted in imperial nostalgia and myths of British exceptionalism, coming up as they have â especially since 2008 â against the reality that Britain is no longer a major world power.
This is evident in Mrs. Mayâs rhetoric. Her Brexit speech, for instance, invited us to imagine the â
The bullishness of the Brexiteers represents a progression from an earlier era of revived empire nostalgia that might be described as the âKeep Calm and Carry Onâ era. From the mid-2000s, tropes such as the titular wartime posters, alongside a rediscovered love for old-timey delicacies like tea, 
These tropes abide today â but they have ceased acting merely as a shelter, for those who live surrounded by them, 
But no matter how confident the Brexiteers might be, their grip on reality remains patchy at best. Global Britainâs delusions are unlikely to withstand the shock of actually leaving the European Union. One indication of this came shortly after the referendum result, when it emerged that Marmite, an iconic British food, was actually owned by a Dutch company, Unilever. Its 
Still, Mrs. May will probably be able to carry the public with her. Her Brexit plans have generally polled well, and since taking office she has remained by far the most popular of all the major party leaders. Even if there is an economic collapse when Britain leaves the European Union â as most analysts think is likely â her mandate probably wonât be hurt: Already the right-wing press is lining up to lay the blame for the coming crisis on the bad attitude of âRemoaners,â as it has labeled the âliberal elitistsâ who remain pro-Europe even after the referendum result.
So whatâs going to happen? These days, it feels like the worst-case scenario always prevails. If that happens this time, too, Brexit will mean that England, shorn of Scotland, Northern Ireland and maybe even Wales, contracts into a small, isolated, one-party state governed by schoolteacherly Conservatives who persist in wild-eyed delusions about their countryâs special grandeur. In this desperate fantasy Britain, there are no jobs, and any dissent â from disseminating pro-foreigner propaganda to having a nonregulation haircut â will be punished by forced participation in the governmentâs âClean for the Queenâ program (which incidentally is a real initiative that was pioneered last year to encourage Her Majestyâs subjects to de-litter their neighborhoods in preparation for her birthday).
All of this might sound bizarre, over-the-top, even actively demented. But if what the Brexiteers want is to return Britain to a utopia they have devised by splicing a few rose-tinted memories of the 1950s together with an understanding of imperial history derived largely from images on vintage biscuit tins, then all of this seems chillingly plausible, insofar as it would, in many ways, constitute the realization of that dream. Viva Britannia!

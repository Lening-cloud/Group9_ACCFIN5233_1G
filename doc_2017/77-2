If Gary D. Cohn is no longer considered a serious contender to take over the Federal Reserve, as multiple news media outlets report, whatâs next for him?
More important, will President Trump decide to keep Janet L. Yellen as leader of Americaâs central bank, or will he turn to someone like the former Fed governor Kevin Warsh?
â¢ Mr. Cohnâs public criticism of the presidentâs response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va. has made it much less likely that he will succeed Ms. Yellen at the Fed, according to 
â¢ 
â¢ Even after his criticism of the president, Mr. Cohn has said that he needs to stay on board to work on matters like an overhaul of the tax code. Itâs possible that if the initiative succeeds, he could regain Mr. Trumpâs favor.
Ms. Yellinâs tenure as chairwoman of the Fed expires in February. The White House could renominate her. Or it could pick from other candidates, including these mentioned by the news media:
â¢ John Taylor, an economist at Stanford
â¢ Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School
â¢ John Allison, the former chief executive of BB&T Bank
â¢ Jerome Powell, a current Fed governor
â¢ Mr. Warsh, a former Fed governor
But a potential strike against him is that he is also viewed as more of a âhawk,â in favor of raising rates more quickly to squash inflation. And Mr. Trump has been public in saying that keeping unemployment low is one of his biggest economic priorities, meaning that he would probably favor keeping rates low.
Another potential sticking point is that Mr. Warsh is close to Mr. Cohn.
As for the future of Mr. Cohn, his friends and associates have long speculated that if he were not nominated as the next Fed chairman, he would leave his White House post.
And a big question is how the markets will react to the latest bout of Fed speculation. Investors have panicked before when rumors arose that Mr. Cohn might resign.
âI think if he steps away, it would crash the markets,â Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yaleâs School of Management, 
Mr. Trump will also need to fill four of seven Fed board seats after Stanley Fischerâs 
The White House has already nominated Randal K. Quarles to become a Fed vice chairman.
And it has also settled on nominating Marvin Goodfriend, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, but that choice has not yet been made formal.
The activist investor Nelson Peltz has finally laid out his proposal for shaking up Procter & Gamble, and it calls for completely reorganizing the consumer products giant.
Here are the main points from 
â¢ Shrink P.&G.âs business units to three from 10. The keepers: beauty, grooming and health care; fabric and home care; and baby, feminine and family care
â¢ Make research and development more efficient. âP.&G. hasnât created a new leading brand in nearly 20 years, while innovation for legacy brands has not stemmed market share losses,â Trian asserts.
â¢ Ensure that 25 of P.&G.âs 100 top executives have âsignificantâ outside experience, to combat what the investment firm says is an âinsularâ corporate culture.
â¢ Do more digital advertising, particularly as smaller rivals like Dollar Shave Club steal market share from P.&G. brands like Gillette.
Mr. Peltz, whose firm owns a $3.5 billion stake in P.&G., also wants a seat on the board.
âGiven that Trian is one of P.&G.âs largest shareholders, Nelson Peltz will be a motivated independent director with a laser focus on long-term sustainable shareholder value creation that can accelerate positive change â as he has done with many other consumer companies over the past 40 years.â
âWhile the P.&G. Board and management team will review Trianâs âwhite paperâ in more detail, it remains clear Trian has an outdated view of our company. The fact is P.&G. is a profoundly different company than it was just a few years ago.â
The biggest British companies have been asked to publicly back the governmentâs approach to leaving the European Union, prompting anger among executives who say they will not be âstrong-armedâ by ministers, 
A letter drawn up by 10 Downing Street praised Prime Minister Theresa May for trying to secure a transition period after Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019 and expressed confidence in the future of âa global Britain.â
The response was not particularly enthusiastic.
One unidentified executive at a FTSE 100 company:
âThere is no way we could sign this, given the current state of chaos surrounding the talks.â
Another executive:
âYouâd have to be craven, or maneuvering for a knighthood.â
And an unidentified government minister:
âI have no idea who in Number 10 thought this was a good idea.â
Business owners were already furious over a leaked Home Office plan to restrict the migration of lower-skilled European Union workers after Britain leaves the block, which was reported by 
The British Hospitality Association said the idea was potentially âcatastrophicâ and the National Farmers Union said it would cause âmassive disruption to the entire food chain,â

LONDON â The British government said on Monday that it intended to formally notify the European Union on March 29 of its intention to leave the bloc, putting the country on track to complete a withdrawal by early 2019.
David Davis, the cabinet minister responsible for negotiating the exit, said that Britain would send notice next week to start a two-year negotiated exit, 
Shortly after the announcement, 
Prime Minister Theresa May, who had promised to begin the process of negotiating a withdrawal by the end of March, is apparently hoping that the end of the negotiations will conclude before the next elections to the European Parliament in summer 2019 and the next general election in Britain, 
The British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.
That, however, is arguably the easiest part. Mrs. May now moves on to what promises to be a hideously complex process of disentangling Britain from more than four decades of European integration, and there are concerns that it will be impossible to complete the negotiations within two years.
Mrs. May has prioritized the desire to control immigration and to reject the authority of the European Court of Justice, effectively ruling out membership in the European Unionâs customs union and in its single market in goods and many services.
She has also threatened to walk away from the negotiating table with no agreement 
As she negotiates with Continental Europe, 
Mr. Davis, in his statement, said that he was aiming for âa deal that works for every nation and region of the U.K. and indeed for all of Europe â a new, positive partnership between the U.K. and our friends and allies in the European Union.â
The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, offered a very different perspective. He accused the government of âembarking on an extreme and divisive Brexit,â adding that Mrs. May âhas rushed this through without a plan, and without a clue.â

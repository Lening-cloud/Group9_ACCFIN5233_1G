In an unpredictable world, itâs always a pleasure to claim vindication for oneâs own prophetic powers, and 
That mystique is undeserved because it is too kind to her decision, lauded for its idealism but ultimately deeply reckless and destabilizing, to swiftly admit a million-odd migrants into the heart of Europe in 2015. No recent move has so clearly highlighted the undemocratic, Berlin-dominated nature of European decision making and the gulf between the elite consensus and popular opinion. And no move has contributed so much to the disturbances since â the worsening of 
So itâs fitting that the immigration issue has finally come back to undercut Merkel directly, first costing her votes in Germanyâs last election, which saw unprecedented gains for the nationalist Alternative for Germany party, and then making a potential grand coalition impossible in part because the centrist, pro-business Free Democrats now see an opportunity in getting to Merkelâs right on migration policy.
Yes, thanks to the continued fallout from her rash decision, and just as her critics predicted, Germany stares into the abyss of â¦
â¦ well, actually, no, it doesnât really stare into the abyss at all. It just has to choose between a new election, which would probably deliver the same divisions but would still leave the nationalists stuck at 10-15 percent of the vote and Merkelâs party with a plurality, and a minority government led by Merkel herself, which would be a novelty in Berlin but which is normal enough in other stable Western countries.
Both options promise problems that Germany hasnât had to deal with in its modern and unified shape, but also problems that are quite routine for developed-world democracies. Neither option is going to suddenly elevate the AfD to power, unravel the European Union, or bring National Socialism lurching back to life. As political crises go, the one Merkel has brought upon her country isnât exactly a Weimar moment, or even a Trump-scale shock. And for all the pleasures of âI told you so,â those of us who never bought into the Merkel mystique should not pretend that sheâs delivered some sort of catastrophe just yet.
Instead, what sheâs delivered is an opportunity for leaders in Germany and in the wider West to learn from her mistakes. For all the understandable talk about the crisis of Western liberalism, the political chaos of the last few years has 
President Trump is a political weakling, not a Caesar; Marine Le Pen canât break 35 percent of Franceâs presidential vote; the Islamic State has all-but-fallen. Which means that the custodians of the liberal order, the kind of people wringing their hands over Merkelâs present struggles, still have an opportunity to prove their critics wrong, to show that their worldview is more adaptable to changed circumstances than it has seemed.
Iâm not sure theyâre ready for that adaptation; instead, my sense of the state of Western elites after Trump and Brexit is similar to the analysis 
Indeed, all the high-level agita surrounding Germanyâs political crisis â 
But while itâs possible that a Bourbon Restoration scenario awaits, in which our overclass learns nothing and forgets nothing during the Trumpian disruption, there is something mildly encouraging in the willingness of Merkelâs competitors in the political center, not just on the extreme right, to act as though theyâve learned lessons from her high-minded blunder, and to campaign and negotiate as if the publicâs opinions about migration policy should actually prevail. Better that kind of crisis-generating move by far, in fact, than a grand coalition of parties united only in their anti-populism, and perfectly designed to ratify the populist critique that all the elites are in cahoots.
What will save the liberal order, if it is to be saved, will be the successful integration of concerns that its leaders have dismissed or ignored back into normal political debate, an end to what Josh Barro of Business Insider has 
In Angela Merkelâs Europe right now, that should mean making peace with Brexit, ceasing to pursue ever further political centralization by undemocratic means, breaking up the â60s-era intellectual cartels that control the commanding heights of culture, creating space for religious resistance to the lure of nihilism and suicide â and accepting that the days of immigration open doors are over, and the careful management of migrant flows is a central challenge for statesmen going forward.
But a necessary first step, in the country that really rules the continent, would be for more people to recognize that if Merkelâs long rule is threatened it need not be a sign of liberalism in crisis, but rather an indicator that it could yet be restored to health.

Americans, âThe Great British Baking Showâ as you have known it is coming to an end.
The season finale was broadcast in some markets last week on PBS, which has aired only the four most recent of its seven seasons. The broadcaster said it would air one of the three earliest seasons of the show â which is called âThe Great British Baking Showâ in the United States and âThe Great British Bake Offâ everywhere else â but after that, things will be different.
For one, PBS, which also licenses âThe Great British Baking Showâ to Netflix, said it had not yet decided whether to air future seasons in the United States. What is going on?
âThe Great British Bake Offâ 
Last September, the showâs producer, Love Productions, 
Three of its hosts â the celebrity chef Mary Berry and the comedians Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc â quickly quit in a messy public airing of grievances over the financially motivated change. They have been replaced.
So what comes next for the show and its beloved ex-hosts? And will Americans be able to watch any of it?
Paul Hollywood, the one host who did not quit, will be part of what amounts to a reboot with three new co-hosts: the chef and writer Prue Leith and the comedians Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding. The season premiere is âcoming soon,â the show said on Twitter.
It also tweeted an apparent nod to the turmoil that has shadowed âThe Great British Bake Offâ since last year: a video in which anthropomorphized baked goods sing âwe all stand together,â even as they are thrust into an oven. Love Productions declined to comment.
So, who are the newcomers?

Mary Berry, a celebrity chef and fan favorite who has been cooking on British television for decades, has been busy since she quit âBake Offâ last year.
The BBC has been happy to continue working with her. In the last year, she has hosted two BBC shows, âMary Berryâs Secrets From Britainâs Great Housesâ and âMary Berry Everyday.â And earlier this month, the broadcaster announced a third show to be hosted by her: âBritainâs Best Cook.â
The BBC said the new show would look for the best of âmodern British home cooking,â like roast beef, chicken curry or chocolate pudding. PBS said it had not made a decision about broadcasting Ms. Berryâs new projects.

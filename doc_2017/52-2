RT, a state-run Russian television network that broadcasts around the world in English, was implicated in a recently declassified United States intelligence report that accused the Russia government of meddling in the American presidential election to tip the vote in favor of Donald J. Trump.
The Russians are accused of hacking the email systems of the Democratic National Committee and conducting a widespread disinformation campaign that included the propagation of fake news stories on the internet and the airwaves.
RTâs coverage of Hillary Clinton âthroughout the U.S. presidential campaign was consistently negative and focused on her leaked emails and accused her of corruption, poor physical and mental health and ties to Islamic extremism,â the declassified intelligence report said.
RT, formerly called Russia Today, was founded in 2005 as part of the state-owned news agency RIA Novosti. The network describes itself on its website as the first âRussian 24/7 English-language news channel which brings the Russian view on global news.â President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said the network was created to â
Though the network is owned and operated by the Russian government, its executives say their journalists are independent. 
In the United States, RT America is broadcast by cable companies in some cities, is carried by Dish, the satellite television provider, and can be found free online. Larry King, the former CNN host, and Ed Schultz, a former MSNBC host, both have programs on the network.
The role of RT in the Kremlinâs effort to influence the election is covered in more detail than any other part of Russiaâs campaign in the report, released by the 
According to the report, the network aggressively uses the internet and social media to conduct âstrategic messaging for the Russian government.â RT videos receive more than one million views a day on YouTube, according to the report, and the networkâs programming was âaimed at undermining viewersâ trust of US democratic procedures.â
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released on Friday a report that detailed what it called a Russian campaign to influence the election. The report is the unclassified summary of a highly sensitive assessment from American intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
Mr. Trump also appeared on Mr. Kingâs program, âPoliticking,â during the campaign.
On Friday, Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, posted a 
âAaa, the C.I.A. report is out!â she wrote. âLaughter of the year! Intro to my show from 6 years ago is the main evidence of Russiaâs influence at US elections. This is not a joke!â
Analysts say Russia lacks the economic and military power to combat NATO, the European Union or the United States directly. The country has instead invested in âweaponizedâ information, using hacking, propaganda and other means to sow doubt and division in other countries. The goal is to weaken cohesion among Western allies, stir discord in their domestic politics and blunt opposition to Russia.
Last year, 
Russian intelligence agents used a variety of means to spread misinformation. âWe mean everything from internet trolls to propaganda and misinformation spread by media companies like RT and Sputnik,â Wilhelm Unge, a spokesman for the Swedish Security Service, said during a speech to that agency last year.
In 2014, Russian news media produced multiple theories about the destruction of 
That same year, an RT America anchor quit during a live broadcast to protest the networkâs coverage of Russiaâs invasion and occupation of Crimea. âPersonally, I cannot be part of a network funded by the Russian government which whitewashes the actions of Putin,â said 
It is not clear how many people RT and Sputnik reach. The numbers released by the Broadcastersâ Audience Research Board in Britain for the week of the âBrexitâ vote in late June, a week of particularly heavy TV watching nationwide, for example, showed it had 926,000 viewers, or 1.57 percent of the audience.

Religion makes great material for horror stories. It wrestles with the same mysteries as that genre does â death, the soul, the nature of evil. It traffics in awe, which is a closely related emotion to terror. Catholicism, with its richness of symbols and incense-perfumed ritual, has been a staple of scary fiction right up through Foxâs current iteration of 
This 10-episode series begins after the election as pope of Lenny Belardo (Jude Law), a fresh-faced, little-known American. The church establishment, led by the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Voiello (Silvio Orlando), hopes he will be âa telegenic puppetâ and a bridge between church conservatives and liberals. Cardinal Belardo chooses the name Pius XIII.
For the complacent cardinals, XIII proves to be an unlucky number. The new pope is, superficially, novel: Heâs hooked on Cherry Coke Zero, heâs pop-culture literate, he â well, he looks like Jude Law. But his beliefs turn out to be militantly conservative, if not medieval.
The church, Pius declares, has become too tolerant and ecumenical; it must not meet people where they are but withdraw and demand, without compromise, that the faithful come to it. Heâs not a bridge but a drawbridge, and heâs pulling himself up.
Whatâs more, heâs a tyrant. He has a priest break the seal of confession to share his cardinalsâ secrets, the better to blackmail and rule by fear. (Itâs not a sin if the pope does it, he assures the confessor.) Spurning 
And his first public address is not the warm greeting the crowd in St. Peterâs Square hopes for, but a terrifying harangue. âYou have forgotten God!â he raves, declaring that his papacy will abandon the feel-good rhetoric of reaching out to oneâs fellow man. Forget man! Only God matters. âYou need to know that I will never be close to you,â he says. âI donât know if you deserve me.â
The creator and director Paolo Sorrentino shoots the scene stunningly: Pius is backlit, and appears only as a furious shadow on a balcony. Mr. Sorrentino, a visual maximalist who explored Italian politics 
In certain moments, thatâs what âThe Young Popeâ is. But itâs also pulpy and disjointed, an art-house âVatican of Cards.â
When âThe Young Popeâ is bad, itâs epically so â laughable, with histrionics and mustache-twirling and bombastic set pieces. Itâs weakest the closer it sticks to its narrative of church intrigue.
It wrings a sneering performance from James Cromwell as Piusâs jealous mentor, Cardinal Spencer. Thereâs an absurd subplot in which Ester (Ludivine Sagnier), a devout, married Madonna figure, is drafted to seduce Pius into a scandal. And Mr. Law is saddled with stiff dialogue: âI am the young popeâ â he actually calls himself that â âI put no stock in consensus.â
When itâs good â well, itâs still often pretty bad, but itâs also gorgeous and appealingly weird. Mr. Sorrentino composes shots as if painting religious art, and âThe Young Popeâ looks awesome in both the vernacular and spiritual senses. Pius, seen from the perspective of a kneeling cardinal, appears as tall as the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. A lush scene of Pius donning his vestments, scored to 
There is something very current about this series, and not simply because Pius is a norm-breaking, reactionary American interloper, running against the establishment and seeking to engird his church with a big, beautiful wall (with a tiny door). âThe Young Popeâ echoes a larger phenomenon, of which our election was just one part: the movement toward retreat and insularity in the West, an attitude that Pius sees as a holy mandate. Brexit, meet Pontifexit.
Mr. Law, with a geographically indeterminate American accent, plays Lenny/Pius as a ball of holy anger, his eyes flashing cold lightning. An abandoned child, his natural state is isolation, his faith a kind of misanthropy. âNo one loves me,â he says, âwhich is why Iâm prepared for every kind of vileness from everyone.â
Is he a fanatic or a nonbeliever? Saint or Antichrist? Old Testament or New? He seems to be all these things variously, as well as a kind of self-styled artist. He refuses to let his image be disseminated, likening himself to 
These are theoretically interesting ideas, but the net effect is that Pius is a black box whose behavior changes to fit the needs of a given scene. For all its arresting images and symbols, âThe Young Popeâ is still a serial driven by story, and the narrative and character motivations are slapdash and underdeveloped. Like Frank Underwood in âHouse of Cards,â Pius also suffers from a lack of worthy, competent antagonists as he steamrollers his opposition.
If youâre going to appreciate âThe Young Pope,â it will probably be on the nonliteral level of spectacle. Early in the season, the Australian government gifts a kangaroo (just go with it) to the Vatican, and Pius orders it released into the papal gardens. Later, he comes upon the beast on a nighttime walk, and these two odd creatures stare each other down.
Itâs in the feeling that this kind of surreal moment induces â where youâre caught between wonder and the urge to hoot with laughter â that âThe Young Popeâ may come closest to God.

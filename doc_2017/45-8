People who canât stand U2âs earnest, heal-the-world side may want to turn elsewhere right now. The word âlove,â unironic and high-minded, recurs all over 
Where âSongs of Innocenceâ was full of youthful biographical specifics, both euphoric and grim, from the groupâs lead singer and main lyricist, Bono, âSongs of Experienceâ has an adultâs broader, more general perspective. It favors lessons and archetypes, not stories. Like âSongs of Innocence,â the new album employed multiple producers, and U2 has clearly pondered every nanosecond of sound, whether polishing its reverberations or administering calibrated amounts of distortion. Itâs not an album that courts new fans by radically changing U2âs style; instead, it reaffirms the sound that has been filling arenas and stadiums for decades.
The album is also a return to the standard commercial market. Apple made âSongs of Innocenceâ 
Bono has described âSongs of Experienceâ as a collection of letters to family, fans and America: messages and advisories from a globally minded public figure. And for most of the album, U2 sets out to counter the anger, despair and cynicism of 2017 with insistent optimism.
Thatâs a temptation to preach, and some songs are unabashed homilies. Bookending the album (before a bonus track) are songs titled âLove Is All We Have Leftâ and âLove Is Bigger Than Anything in Its Way.â The opener is a celestial benediction over tremulous strings, declaring, âNothing to stop this being the best day ever,â while the finale is a grand crescendo of a march, an arena anthem declaring, âWhen you think youâre done, youâve just begun.â
But in between, thereâs more ambivalence, humor, self-questioning and openly political intent. âYouâre the Best Thing About Me,â with an exultant leap in its melody and the Edgeâs quick-strummed guitar at its core, is a love song that shades into a warning: âThe best things are easy to destroy.â The cheerful 1950s-style beat of âThe Showman (Little More Better)â gives Bono a springboard to mock the artifice of his role as a pop singer: âMaking a spectacle of falling apart is/Just the start of the show.â
Meanwhile, U2 has been thinking hard about migrants. âRed Flag Dayâ â with the nimble syncopations of the Edgeâs rhythm-guitar chords, Adam Claytonâs bass and Larry Mullen Jr.âs drums meshing like the Police â starts as a romp at a Mediterranean beach paradise but ends up thinking about migrants drowned in those same waters. The fuzz-toned stomp of âAmerican Soulâ begins as an Irish bandâs tribute to American rock ânâ roll but goes on to praise the idea of America welcoming outsiders from all over: âFor refugees like you and me/a country to receive us/Will you be my sanctuary/Refu-Jesus!â
Yet even U2âs faith and hope face their limits in the era of âBrexitâ and President Trump.

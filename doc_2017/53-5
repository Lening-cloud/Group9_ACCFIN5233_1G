Dina H. Powell, a deputy national security adviser to President Trump and a key player on a variety of foreign policy issues since the early days of his administration, will step down early next year, the White House said on Friday.
Ms. Powell 
âDina Powell has been a key, trusted adviser in this administration,â said the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. âShe has always planned to serve one year before returning home to New York, where she will continue to support the presidentâs agenda and work on Middle East policy.

And itâs a division of one of Chinaâs biggest internet giants.
Spotify and Tencentâs music unit, known as TME, agreed to buy stakes in each other, forging a potentially crucial bond for the streaming giant ahead of its potential new life as a publicly traded company. Spotify is still weighing whether to list its shares in a direct listing, avoiding the complex process of an I.P.O.
But being a public company means that investors will want to see impressive growth. Forming a partnership with Tencent helps give Spotify an important step up in that regard, by giving it a toehold in China.

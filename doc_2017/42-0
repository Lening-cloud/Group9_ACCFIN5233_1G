Bucking fears that the Netherlands would be the next populist domino after Britainâs vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trumpâs election in the United States, the Dutch turned out in record numbers 
The Dutch parliamentary election was a highly fractured affair, with 28 parties competing for 150 seats. It takes 76 seats to form a government. Though the final result will not be announced until Tuesday, with most of the votes already counted, Prime Minister Mark Rutteâs center-right Peopleâs Party for Freedom and Democracy won with 33 seats. Mr. Rutte will have to seek â as is the usual case in the Netherlands â partners to form a coalition government, which could take weeks or even months.

They predicted a far stronger showing by Mr. Wilders, and missed the Brexit and Trump victories.

Nor would a defeat for Ms. Le Pen in May put an end to her movement. The Dutch vote is encouraging, but the threat of far-right populism in Europe continues.

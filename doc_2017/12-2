LONDON â On a day that blended dull ritual with undeniable historical import, Britain formally began its departure from the European Union with the delivery of a 
Two years of grinding divorce negotiations now begin, with the outcome unclear, except that the talks are certain to be contentious and spiteful â and that the only sure winners will be lawyers and trade negotiators.
For the first time, the European bloc is losing a member, not to mention its second-largest economy. The multilateral architecture that has shaped the Western world since the aftermath of World War II has taken a severe blow, and as the letter was delivered on Wednesday, questions abounded about whether this pivot toward nationalism and self-interest represented the beginning of a more volatile global era.
The British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.
Few people predicted the British exit,

The question now is whether some Europeans, having watched the first aftereffects of the vote to withdraw and the American presidential vote â political division in Britain and the fall of the pound, and 
Picking winners at such a volatile moment is perilous, but many analysts agree that the British withdrawal, and the uncertainty it produced, has been good news for Russia, and possibly for China, as two large powers that can exercise greater leverage in negotiations with individual European capitals than with a tightly unified European bloc that, taken together, is a geopolitical powerhouse.
â âBrexitâ surely strengthens the disintegrative processes already underway in the E.U., and therefore is a boonâ to Russia, said James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. âThe E.U. is more powerful than any single actor, even Germany, so anything that diminishes a rival in the zero-sum terms in which Russia thinks strengthens the Russian voice in Europe.â
Britainâs absence at the European table could also help the Russian president, 
The coming exit from the European Union has already turned Britain inward, with the government and the countryâs powerful tabloid news media fixated on the particulars of its withdrawal: the uncertainties of whether the country will maintain access to the blocâs single market; demands that the country take control of its borders to stunt immigration; and an insistence on âreclaiming sovereigntyâ by returning lawmaking powers to London.
Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how âBrexitâ has affected business so far.
Those themes of national sovereignty and curbing immigration resonate across the Continent, which is why some saw the British exit as a political precursor and the European Union as an endangered species.
In December, however, 
This month, the Dutch gave the far-right anti-European politician Geert Wilders fewer votes than expected in a northern European country similar in its political outlook to Britain. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel remains popular in the polls, although weakened by her long service in the job and by severe criticism of her 2015 âopen-doorâ immigration policy. The anti-euro, anti-immigration Alternative for Deutschland is slipping, however, and Ms. Merkelâs main challenger is the pro-European

As European voters seem to be tentatively endorsing unity, Britain is confronted with widening divisions. On Tuesday, less than 24 hours before the exit letter was delivered to Brussels, 
With her government desperate to maintain Britainâs standing in the world, Mrs. May has turned to President Trump. He and his chief political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, are deeply skeptical of multilateralism, free trade and âentangling alliances.â While NATO may pass muster as a security shield (provided everyone pays up), the European Union, like the United Nations, seems an example of the world that Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon want to dismantle or, at the very least, weaken.
Yet Mrs. May has also tried to present Britain as committed to globalization and to global trade â as, effectively, still open for business. It is a tricky circle to square, demonstrating how difficult it is to predict Britainâs future. Some envision the countryâs fate as being a European equivalent of Singapore, sovereign and respected, a partner eagerly sought by the rest of the world. Others warn that Britain could be left much more isolated than it is now, especially since European leaders feel they must strike a hard bargain.
âThere is a political imperative that âBrexitâ not be seen as a success,â said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, âbecause every government in Europe is challenged to some degree by resurgent nationalists who would be encouraged and inspired by a âBrexitâ success.â
For those British lawmakers in favor of the withdrawal, like Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative legislator, the exit âis a wonderful liberation for my country.â
The single market, he told Prospect magazine, âis a bureaucratic, highly regulated means of making British business more inefficient â itâs about having a closed, inward-looking Fortress Europe approach, rather than engaging with the world.â
There is âno political event in my lifetime that has been better or more exciting for the nation,â he added.
But Mr. Leonard has his doubts.
âBritain may be sailing off to sea,â he said, âbut the welcoming arms wonât be that numerous.â

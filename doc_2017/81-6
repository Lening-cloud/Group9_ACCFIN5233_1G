We begin the lesson with Time Magazineâs short video â
â¢ What images or symbols do you see?
After viewing the video one or two times, we encourage students to share their observations, ideas and questions. Record student questions on a poster to drive the inquiry process throughout the lesson.
Last spring The Times asked readers who support far-right parties in Europe to tell us why they had turned away from mainstream political movements. Share these excerpts from â
â¢ Who is the person? How old is he or she? What is his or her profession?
We then invite students to share some of their examples, focusing on the question: What issues are most important for supporters of the far right? As students share, write a list of the issues on the board for them to refer to throughout the lesson.
Lee Atwater, a political strategist who worked on George Bushâs 1988 presidential campaign, coined the phrase â
In a March episode of the Times podcast â
We provide a listening guide, which we suggest reviewing with students before beginning the program. We also recommend pausing every 2-3 minutes to quickly check for understanding and give students time to record any thoughts. The listening guide is divided into two sections. If your time is limited, the first six minutes provide the essential information about the rise of the far right in Europe. If time permits, continue listening for a more detailed analysis of the situation.
1. What message does Geert Wilders, a far-right politician in the Netherlands, communicate about Islam?
6. What does the Somali example show about scarcity and identity?
To bolster this work, students can read 
â¢ For what are far-right movements in Europe fighting (or against)?

        	I grew up in Marseilleâs northern neighborhoods. In the working-class neighborhoods. My Dad was an electrician at construction sites. I grew up there and it hurts me to see what has happened.
 
Stephane Ravier:
        	These are the neighborhoods where, letâs say 50, 60, 70 percent of the population is Muslim, to begin with. They speak French there too, but these are foreign enclaves. Except when it comes to claiming social benefits. Thatâs when they claim to be French.

-Iâve heard it now.
-Youâre a liar. Youâre doing again a trial. 
-The Stalinist roots are still there.
-Youâre manipulating people. Itâs incredible to listen to this.
-Itâs a scandal.


VO: With the numbers as they are now, the National Front is all but certain to win the region. To block them socialists make a game changing move. They pull out of the race. Forcing their supporters to vote Republican â  Itâs a familiar strategy in French politics. And the move is just enough to give the republicans a slight lead.
VO (FR): Au vu des chiffres, le FN semble Ã  deux doigts de prendre la rÃ©gion. Pour leur faire barrage, les socialistes tentent un coup de poker. Ils se dÃ©sistent au profit de la droite rÃ©publicaine. De quoi donner aux RÃ©publicains une petite avance.

VO: The National Front is pushing back, vying for every last vote.
VO (FR): Le FN joue son va-tout.

SUPER: Election day
TITLE (FR): Le jour des Ã©lections

Stephan: [a text from] âLe Pen, Marion. Who tells me we lost.â
âDemocracy is crying tonight.â

VO (FR): Le FN a perdu de 10 points, et nâa conquis aucune rÃ©gion.
 
Nona: For the moment, I think that all the factors that have helped the progression of the National Front are still there. Weâre in the middle of an economic recession thatâs not going to stop. And the international context- the rise of the Islamic state.
Nona (FR): Je pense que tous les facteurs qui ont aidÃ© Ã  la progression du FN sont toujours intacts. Nous sommes en pleine rÃ©cession. Quant au contexte international, avec lâÃ©mergence de Daech...

They are on their way. They have been getting close to power.
(FR) Ils poursuivent leur route. Ils ne sont pas loin du pouvoir.
 
Nona: But you also see its limitations. They make very good scores in the first round of elections, but then when comes the second round; nobody yet, wants to make an alliance with them. They are unknitting the social and political fabric of the country.
Nona (FR): Mais on entrevoit leurs limites. Si leurs scores au premier tour sont trÃ¨s Ã©levÃ©s, pour lâheure, personne ne veut forger dâalliance avec eux au second tour. Ils sont en train de dÃ©tricoter le tissu social et politique de la France. 

Stephan: Itâs a beautiful victory despite it all. We make progress election after election, so we can win.
In this part of the lesson, students will play the role of journalist as they try to gather the facts about the issues at stake in the presidential 
Before beginning this activity, you may need to build background about 
You also may want to watch the above 
When students have enough background to begin their research, they can work in pairs or small groups to learn about the issues at the heart of the elections in France. You might decide to have each pair or small group focus on one candidate, and then share their research with the rest of the class. Or, you might instead have different members of a group learn about different candidates, before sharing what they learned with the rest of their group. Either way, the goal is to have students understand each candidateâs perspective.
Students can use this

The recent referendum in Turkey, in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed a narrow majority of votes to expand his presidential authority, is the latest example of a puzzling phenomenon: Democratically elected leaders who triumph in elections even as they move toward autocracy by undermining checks and balances and consolidating power.
She then investigates what she calls âthe most common way for a democracy to collapseâ in todayâs world â through the actions of an elected incumbent, not a coup or revolution.
Have students read Ms. Taubâs analysis, and then consider the following questions, for writing and discussion:
1. What role do checks and balances play within a strong democracy? Are they essential? And, why is it dangerous when a democratically elected leader claims popular support for changes that undermine democratic institutions, such as stripping away checks and balances?
2. What role does a free press play within a strong democracy? Is it essential? Is it dangerous when democratically elected leaders curtail press freedom or spread misinformation? Why?
3. Does democracy need an opposition party or leaders? Why is it dangerous when an elected leader limits the oppositionâs ability to campaign or systematically shuts off political opportunities for the opposition?
4. Are democratic elections an effective check on tyranny? And how are deeply polarized societies particularly susceptible to sliding from democracy to autocracy?
5. What do you think citizens in a democracy should do to strengthen democratic traditions and institutions and prevent the possibility of an authoritarian regime taking control? Why?
In an interview this January with Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s, 
In the wake of 
...questions are surfacing around the globe about a revival of fascism, generally defined as a governmental system that asserts complete power and emphasizes aggressive nationalism and often racism. In places like Russia and Turkey, leaders like Vladimir V. Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan employ strongman tactics. In Austria, a nationalist candidate came within three-tenths of a percentage point of becoming the first far-right head of state elected in Europe since World War II.
In this extension lesson, students 
First, ask students to define four key terms: fascism, authoritarianism, populism and nationalism. How do the definitions overlap in some ways? And how are they different?
Then, ask students to choose a fascist or authoritarian leader from the past, perhaps one they have studied in class, and then select a contemporary political figure who has displayed strongman tactics or who has risen to power on a message of extreme national pride and xenophobia. We have created this Venn diagram to help students

To close this lesson, engage students in a discussion of the revival of fascism in todayâs world. Based on evidence from their research, ask students to discuss:

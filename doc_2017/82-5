Two senators â 
The problem with their argument is itâs wrong. 
Pass-throughs have a lower total tax burden than corporations do. That advantage exists now and remains in both the House and Senate versions of the tax bill.
The key point here is that corporations and their investors are taxed twice:
First, a corporate rate on profits is paid directly by the company. Under current law, the top rate is 35 percent. Then, when the business pays returns to its investors, they pay tax on the money theyâve earned when they file in April. That income â dividends and capital gains â is taxed at a top rate of 23.8 percent.
Pass-through businesses, meanwhile, are taxed just once:
These are small and mammoth partnerships, proprietorships and companies with fewer than 100 shareholders known as S corporations... They arenât subjected to any separate business tax, but pay on their individual income tax when the money thrown off by the business is passed through to its owners. The rate depends on what bracket someone is in, but the highest is 39.6 percent.
So while the corporate rate by itself may be lower than the top pass-through rate, the total tax burden on corporations is higher.
But even in Republican rewrite of the tax code â in which the corporate rate is lowered to 20 percent â pass-throughs still come out on top. That again is because corporation are taxed twice.
Six months ago, Don Blankenship â the former C.E.O. of Massey Energy and once one of the most-feared men in the coal industry â shed his label as federal inmate 12393-088.
Now Mr. Blankenship, who was convicted of crimes related to the explosion at the Massey-run Upper Big Branch mine in 2010 that killed 29 men, is pursuing a new career: senator.
One thing Mr. Blankenship wonât have a problem with is name recognition: Heâs one of the best-known figures in West Virginia, both for his decade-long tenure as the C.E.O. of Massey and then for his downfall after the mine explosion.
Our colleague David Segal noted the onetime mogulâs corporate achievements in 
Mr. Blankenshipâs quasi-dictatorial management style as chief executive produced spectacular results for Massey, transforming it from a relatively modest business dominated by a single family into a corporation that operated more than 150 mines and brought in more than $2.6 billion in revenue.
Mr. Blankenship was eventually convicted of having deliberately skirted federal mining safety requirements. Itâs a charge he has consistently denied, and he has called himself an âAmerican political prisoner.â
But Massey was left low after the Upper Big Branch explosion, the worst American mining disaster in four decades. The company

There has certainly been a lot of talk about media mergers in recent weeks.
But all this news may have obscured the fact that media deal making has slowed markedly this year. So far in 2017, the value of announced media deals in 2017 is down 69 percent in the United States from a year ago and 57 percent globally, according to Thomson Reuters.
The total volume of these deals is at its lowest level since 2013 in the United States and 2012 worldwide.
This slowdown is unlikely to reverse soon. The Trump administrationâs 
Few, for example, believe that Comcast â which is in discussions to buy significant portions of 21st Century Fox â would be allowed to complete that potential deal unless the Justice Department was defeated in its AT&T lawsuit.
So until there is a conclusion to the AT&T-Time Warner deal, big media acquisitions are likely on hold.

Siemens said on Wednesday that 
The Healthineers unit is among Siemensâ most profitable businesses, generating 13.8 billion euros, or about $16 billion, in revenue in the companyâs 2017 fiscal year, which ended in September. The Healthineers business supplies technology to the health care industry, including diagnostic imaging and laboratory diagnostics.
Siemans did not disclose the size of the listing or the potential price range but is expected to sell a minority stake of up to 25 percent in the business. Some analysts have estimated that the listing could value the unit at up to â¬40 billion.
Siemens first announced plans to list a minority stake in the business last year.
Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are acting as global coordinators on the listing.
The British cinema owner Cineworld confirmed on Wednesday that it was in advanced discussions to potentially acquire Regal Entertainment Group for about $3.1 billion.
If the deal were to be completed, the two largest movie theater chains in the United States would be owned by overseas companies. AMC Entertainment is owned by the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda.
The confirmation came after Regal said on Tuesday night that it was in discussions with Cineworld about an all-cash transaction to acquire Regal for $23 a share. Shares of Regal are up nearly 5 percent to $20.59 in recent trading.
Regalâs stock has come under pressure this year because of a poor run for box-office movies but also the threat from Netflix, Amazon and other digital streaming companies. That threat is only going to get bigger. 
âSo-called premium video-on-demand could see movies appear on streaming services just weeks after their theatre debuts. That would cut Ebitda by 8 percent, according to Credit Suisse, and make a Hollywood-style happy finale even less likely.â

But 
To show that it would not abuse any increase in power that buying Time Warner would afford, AT&T said that it had offered rival distributors the same sort of deal that the government allowed in the last big vertical media merger, Comcastâs purchase of NBCUniversal.
That includes:

A tax overhaul proposal emerged from the Senate Budget Committee after two notable Republican dissidents, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Bob Corker of Tennessee, said their concerns were resolved.

But itâs bound to get messier. While a federal judge has denied an emergency request by the agencyâs deputy director, Leandra English, to stop Mick Mulvaney from taking over as acting director, her lawsuit is likely to proceed.
While Mr. Mulvaney sits in the directorâs seat, however, he can do a lot to hobble an agency that he has derided as a âsad, sick joke.â He has issued a 30-day freeze on issuing any new rules or regulations. And experts say that he can abandon investigations or shrink the bureauâs budget, according to 
How else to describe the decision by the judge overseeing the companyâs court battle with Alphabetâs self-driving car unit to delay the trial? He did so after discovering that Uber had not produced a letter that he said was potentially relevant evidence.

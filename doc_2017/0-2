The study examined nearly 3,000 Twitter accounts previously linked to Russia by the company’s disclosures in Washington or by news reports and academic researchers.
Examining two weeks of tweets in June 2016, shortly before the June 23 referendum, the study found that only 84 of the identified Russian accounts posted about the referendum, and they generated only 6,734 tweets or retweets. As a result, “we again found little evidence of Russian content,” the authors wrote.

Twitter, in a separate response to the same committee, said it had examined accounts “previously identified as likely funded from Russian sources.” The company said it found only one of those accounts that promoted content about Brexit in the two months before the referendum: the Twitter account of Russia’s English-language news network, Russia Today. The account (@RT_com) spent $44,615.87 on advertising to users in Britain, and only $1,031.99 of that in the two months before the referendum.
It could not be determined whether Russia had used other, not-yet-identified accounts to seek to influence the vote.

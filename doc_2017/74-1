Noah Millman warns his readers not to draw too many firm conclusions about Emmanuel Macronâs defeat of Marine Le Pen in Franceâs election this weekend. The roots of populist discontent that propelled Ms. Le Pen to the fore have not magically disappeared with Mr. Macronâs victory. And Mr. Milliman is skeptical that the solutions neoliberalism provides are an adequate cure for what ails the French people.

Erick Erickson is worried about the state of conservatism. A staunch never-Trump-er, he worries that, just as some Republicans justified the Bush administrationâs âbig government agenda,â too many today are willing to âput the square peg of Trumpism into the round hole of conservatism.â

David Benkof, a conservative opinion columnist whose writing focuses on religious and gay rights issues, argues that President Trumpâs executive order on religious liberty should reassure gay Americans worried that this administration would enact discriminatory policies. He accuses gay organizations of âfear-mongeringâ and defends the president against some of the accusations leveled by gay rights activists.

David French would likely agree with Mr. Benkofâs diagnosis of the religious liberty order but draws a different conclusion about what it means for President Trumpâs fidelity to his campaign promises. Echoing

Heather Hurlburt shares Noah Millmanâs view that Mr. Macronâs victory is less than decisive. Liberals, she writes, should not celebrate the election results for too long. Mr. Macronâs party does not have the candidates or nationwide infrastructure of the National Front, and his government is built on a shaky coalition that should make âMacron fans sober up fast Monday morning.â

This is about as full-throated a defense of centrism as youâll get in the pages of The Nation. Although he finds it âprofoundly frustratingâ that Franceâs left-wing parties couldnât put up a candidate for the countryâs runoff election, John Nichols is nonetheless optimistic about Mr. Macronâs victory.
Unlike Ms. Hurlburt and Mr. Millman, Mr. Nichols sees the broad coalition of voters who supported the centrist candidate as a rejection of the populism that ushered in âBrexitâ and the Trump presidency. Moreover, the American left, he notes, should be particularly happy that France did not vote for someone who would work as âTrumpâs ally or enabler.â

Why donât President Trumpâs supporters abandon him when he fails to keep campaign promises? Bill Scher argues that legislative victories matter less to his base than the presidentâs willingness to take on the right opponents: the media, âelitesâ and the Democrats. The only problem with this strategy? It doesnât win the president any of the new voters he might need for the next election.

While Erick Erickson diagnoses his side of the ideological divide with ossification, Jacob Bacharach contends that the Democratic Party is already dead. The elites of the party, Mr. Bacharach writes, are devoid of ideals and ideas save one: Be scared of Republicans.

George Lakoff is a newly-retired professor of cognitive science and linguistics, which is perhaps why Democratic operatives didnât listen to him when he predicted President Trumpâs victory in 2016. For over a decade, Mr. Lakoff has been arguing that âvoters donât vote their self-interest, they vote their values,â and that two distinct and often unspoken worldviews divide conservatives from progressives. If Democrats want to appeal to swing voters, Mr. Lakoff claims that they must dispose with an Enlightenment worldview dictated by logic and rules and embrace a rhetoric that trades on metaphor and emotion.

Itâs never too early to start speculating about who will run in 2020. At least not for the folks at FiveThirtyEight who deployed some sophisticated data science to determine, with varying degrees of precision, the seven signs that someone will run for president during the next election cycle. After reading the piece, youâll most likely read a lot into Joe Bidenâs next trip to Iowa.

We occasionally use the âcenterâ category to highlight profiles of up-and-coming political stars who defy, in some way, hardened partisan expectations and traits. In this feature for Politico Magazine, Tim Alberta identifies Representative Will Hurd of Texas as one such figure. As long as the 39-year-old black Republican can hold on to his majority-Hispanic district, he might even be the future of the G.O.P.

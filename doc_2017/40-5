Louisa Adams, above, the wife of John Quincy Adams (president from 1825 to 1829), was the first.
She was born in London in 1775. Her mother was English, her father the American consul. Their home became an essential stop for American visitors, including John Quincy, who met Louisa in 1795 and married her in 1797.
Louisa arrived in the U.S. in 1801 when President John Adams brought his diplomat son home for a time. Wherever the couple was posted, her engaging personality stood out. Louisa dazzled imperial courts overseas, and her soirees were the heart of Washington’s social life when John Quincy was secretary of state, proving critical to his ascension to the presidency.
The question of her “Americanness” became an issue during his tumultuous term in office. Her efforts to dispute rumors that she was British only drew more attention to her background.
Louisa continued to be John Quincy’s political partner as he served in Congress after leaving the White House, supporting his antislavery efforts.
When she died in 1852, both Houses adjourned. A Washington publication wrote that hers was one of the “longest funeral processions ever witnessed in this city.”

âMove fast and break thingsâ may have been Facebookâs mantra, but few companies have taken the slogan to heart like Uber Technologies. The ride-hailing company, which not long ago was valued at nearly $70 billion, has pushed aggressively into one market after another.

Aside from valuing the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of the service, some Uber users fear that Transport for Londonâs decision suggests that London isnât as open for business as it likes to appear, especially with the so-called Brexit looming. Yet officials elsewhere have shown themselves even less accommodating. Uber executives were arrested in France, for example. And rules mostly exist for a reason.
It is true that the operators of Londonâs famous, and famously pricey, black cabs, and labor groups, have long lobbied against Uber and its tech-savvy rivals. But the young company has a record of doing whatever suits it best and only answering questions later. Transport for London is right to take doubts about customersâ safety and security seriously, and to consider questions about software that could hamper effective regulation.
As Uber tries to turn its dramatic market-share success into something profitable, the company needs more of that kind of approach. Starting on the Thames, compromise could become its reboot strategy.

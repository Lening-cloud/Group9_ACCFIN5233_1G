LONDON â In one of the most consequential diplomatic events in Britain since World War II, Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday sent formal notice of the countryâs intention to withdraw from the European Union, starting a tortuous two-year divorce littered with pitfalls for both sides.

Mrs. May told Parliament, âToday, the government acted on the democratic will of the British people, and it acts too on the clear and convincing position of this house.â
The British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.
âThe Article 50 process is now underway,â she added, âand, in accordance with the wishes of the British people, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.â
She added: âThis is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back.â She cited the âenduring power of the British spirit.â And she painted a vision of a âtruly global Britain, the best friend and neighbor to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe, too.â
With this step, Mrs. May enters what 
As a result, analysts say, she has frequently stressed her willingness to walk away from the table if a good deal proves elusive, leaving European Union negotiators wondering whether she is serious or trying to bluff her way into a stronger negotiating position.
âI think they would prefer a deal,â 
Given her negotiating âred lines,â the difference between whatever deal Mrs. May can secure and no deal at all may turn out to be relatively small. Blaming the Europeans for a collapse of the talks might be easier, politically, than bringing a weak agreement to Parliament.
The politics are so toxic, Professor Menon added, that they make a disorderly departure from the bloc â often likened to walking off a cliff edge â plausible. âItâs ugly and so frighteningly horrible, that I canât quite believe itâs happening,â he said.
European leaders have emphasized that Britain cannot âcherry pickâ the rules and regulations it likes, and certainly cannot expect to have a better deal than countries that remain in the bloc. The last thing they want to do is lend greater momentum to the centrifugal forces already threatening to tear apart the European Union.
Mr. Tusk said at a news conference in Brussels that there was âno reason to pretend this is a happy day,â and that Britainâs plans to depart the bloc would only leave the 27 remaining members âmore determined and more united.â He added, âWe already miss you.â
Manfred Weber, a German lawmaker and a powerful conservative in the European Parliament, 
Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how âBrexitâ has affected business so far.
What makes the looming confrontation so dangerous is that both sides stand to lose economically in the event of a breakdown.
From agriculture to aviation, from fisheries to pharmaceuticals, Britainâs economy has been shaped by membership in the European Union, its main trading partner. With its single market â the worldâs largest â and its customs union, the European Union ensures customs-free trade across frontiers in goods and some services.
Without a deal, Britain faces customs checks at its borders and tariffs on imports and exports, not to mention the relocation of at least part of its lucrative financial services sector.
But Britain is a big market for Continental Europe, too: Germany alone exports 800,000 vehicles there every year. Though Londonâs dominant financial services sector is hardly popular, many businesses on the Continent rely on its deep capital markets.
Britain is one of only two significant military powers in the bloc â the other is France â and has valuable security and intelligence capabilities that elevate Europe on the global stage.
In her letter to Mr. Tusk, Mrs. May argued that without an overall agreement, âour cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened.â Her officials later denied that this was a threat by Britain, arguing that it reflected the fact that some cooperation on policing issues was conducted through European Union channels.
But Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliamentâs negotiator for Britainâs exit, said there could be no âtrade-offâ in talks between such issues and trade. âI think that the security of our citizens is far too important,â Mr. Verhofstadt said.
To make matters more difficult, the final deal will require votes in perhaps 38 legislatures across Europe, as well as in the British Parliament.
It is even possible that the negotiations could founder over the issue of money before they really get underway. Michel Barnier, the negotiator appointed by the European Commission, wants to resolve the terms of the departure before moving on to future trade ties.
The commission estimates that Britain owes as much as $64 billion in future spending commitments and pension entitlements for European Union officials. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has rejected that idea, invoking the memory of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who in 1984 demanded â and received â her âmoney backâ from European partners in another acrimonious negotiation.
Diplomats say a collapse over money matters can be avoided if specifics are left until the end of the talks, when the parameters of a trade deal are known. European officials seem open to that idea of reaching agreement on the principles and methodology of calculating what Britain owes, based on commitments undertaken while it was a member. That would allow Mrs. May to justify payments as part of a deal allowing continued access to European markets.
âIf you go narrow, it is tremendously difficult,â Mr. Fritz-Vannahme added. âIt will not bring the problem to a conclusion in two years.â
He said he believed one danger was the âillusionâ among some in Brussels that the European Union was âstrong enough to live without the Brits,â who still have significant economic and military power. Another is the illusion among some Britons that they can dictate the terms of a deal.
Professor Menon, too, said he thought the messages from some British politicians, reinforced by tabloid newspapers aggressively for the exit, were destructive. âThe British people now think that Europeans will be stupid if they donât give us a good deal, because itâs in their own interest,â he said.
Time will be a problem, too. British businesses want a transition period to adapt to the circumstances after withdrawal, but this requires an agreement on what Britain would transition to after 2019. And unless all this is decided quickly, it will be of little use; companies will not be able to wait long into 2018 before assuming the worst outcome and acting accordingly, even if that means a sharp economic adjustment.
âWhatever happens, she is not going to have a great deal,â Professor Menon said, referring to Mrs. May. âIt is still going to involve a lot of pain, given that we are outside the customs union and the single market.â

Nigel Farage, the right-wing British politician and outspoken supporter of President Trump, plans to campaign in Alabama on Monday against the president’s preferred candidate in a crucial Republican Senate runoff.
Mr. Farage’s endorsement of Roy Moore, a former State Supreme Court justice who leads in the polls before the election on Tuesday, lines up another anti-establishment voice in opposition to Mr. Trump. He plans to speak at a rally for Mr. Moore that will also include 
“I’m honored to have the endorsement of Brexit leader @Nigel_Farage, who’ll join us in Fairhope on Monday,” Mr. Moore 
Mr. Farage, the former U.K. Independence Party leader who helped lead the “Brexit” movement, 
The Alabama race to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions pits Mr. Moore, an evangelical favorite, against Luther Strange, who has the support of Mr. Trump and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. Mr. Strange was appointed to the Senate this year after Mr. Sessions left.
The runoff has put the candidates’ supporters into the tricky position of trying not to offend the other side. Mr. Trump has said he would campaign for Mr. Moore in the general election if he wins. And Breitbart News, the far-right website led by Mr. Bannon, 
Mr. Trump has wagered his political capital on Mr. Strange, 
Even with the president’s support, Mr. Strange trails by single digits, and a loss will raise questions about the reach of Mr. Trump’s influence among the Republican Party’s conservative base.
If Mr. Strange succeeds, he will have to defeat a faction of anti-Washington forces aligning with Mr. Moore. In addition to support from Mr. Bannon, Mr. Moore has received endorsements from Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, and Phil Robertson, the star of the reality show “Duck Dynasty.”
Democrats in Alabama are rooting for Mr. Moore, believing that his views on homosexuality and social issues would make him more vulnerable than Mr. Strange in the general election.

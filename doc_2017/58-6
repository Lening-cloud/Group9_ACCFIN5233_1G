From 
I have struggled for many years with a substance addiction. I have decided that the most important thing I can do right now is to take care of my problem.
I have disclosed that decision to the company, and we mutually agreed that it was appropriate that I resign. I will always appreciate the human understanding and warmth that Bob [Iger, Disney’s C.E.O.] displayed here and always.
But as cable TV providers lose customers to streaming services, ESPN has become 
“There is no obvious successor for Skipper, who has overseen multiple executive shake-ups over the last year. Top executives inside the company include Connor Schell, head of content; Justin Connolly, head of sales and marketing; Russell Wolff, head of ESPN International; and Burke Magnus, head of programming.”
Berkshire’s class A shares on Monday crossed $300,000 for the first time.
The stock is up more than 1 percent in recent trading and nearly 11 percent since mid-November. The stock has rallied as optimism for the enactment of the Republican tax overhaul has grown. Berkshire’s focus on the United States means the company stands to be a big winner from the bill’s passage,

“Mr. Buffett put in his first order to buy 2,000 shares with Wall Street broker Tweedy, Browne and Reilly back on Dec. 12, 1962. He paid $7.50 a share for his initial stake. That’s an increase of roughly four million percent.”
Mr. Buffett took control of Berkshire in 1965 and built the struggling textile company into a conglomerate. Along the way, the stock steadily climbed. It ”pierced the $1,000 level in 1983, passed $10,000 in 1992 and hit $100,000 for the first time in 2006. It first touched $250,000 intraday 
Mr. Buffett currently owns 17 percent of the company, worth about $85 billion.
Here’s what Denise Morrison of Campbell had to say about her company’s acquisition:
The acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance will accelerate Campbell’s strategy and is in line with our Purpose, ‘real food that matters for life’s moments.’ It will provide our consumers with an even greater variety of better-for-you snacks.
And here’s what Michele Buck of Hershey said:
The acquisition of Amplify and its product portfolio is an important step in our journey to becoming an innovative snacking powerhouse as together it will enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key sub-segment of the warehouse snack aisle.”
For Campbell: Credit Suisse, Rothschild and Weil, Gotshal & Manges
For Snyder’s-Lance: Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Jenner & Block
For Hershey: JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom
For Amplify: Jefferies and Godwin Procter
For decades, the company best known for its sometimes maddening-to-assemble low-priced furniture has also had a reputation as a master tax avoider, making use of complex legal structures to minimize its tax bill.
That organization was satirically illustrated in

The company’s business model was changed to a franchise structure in the early 1980s, with Inter Ikea operating its franchise business. Inter Ikea, through a Dutch subsidiary, receives franchise fees equal to 3 percent of the revenue from Ikea stores worldwide, according to regulators. Although Ikea was founded in Sweden in 1943, the parent company is based in the Netherlands.
European regulators are concerned in particular about a 2006 Dutch ruling that allowed Inter Ikea to send a significant part of its franchise profits, in the form of an annual license fee, to a company in Luxembourg, where it was not taxed.
Over the years, Ikea has argued that its business structure was perfectly legal.
Increasing optimism that the Republican tax overhaul will be signed into law this week has pushed shares of bank stocks to levels not hit since before the financial crisis.
The KBW Nasdaq bank index is up 1.3 percent to 107.52, its highest level since October 2007. Banks are expected to be among the biggest beneficiaries of the tax bill, which will lower the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. That’s because their effective tax rate tends to be higher,
Goldman Sachs in a note Monday said lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 percent could lead to a 14 percent increase in earnings per share on average for banks. Wells Fargo, according to Goldman’s analysis, stands to be the biggest beneficiary, with an 18 percent increase in its earnings per share.
The narrative of the week is clearly going to be the tax plan, which is almost certain to pass Congress this week. The real question is how the business community will react (not everyone is applauding) and whether the overhaul will change corporate America’s view of President Trump.
Last week, I attended Jeffrey Sonnenfeld’s Yale C.E.O. Summit, where some of the biggest business leaders in the world participate and talk candidly about issues from business to policy — and, this year, did so just as the tax plan seemed to turn a corner.
The event is considered off-the-record, so I can’t share exact details of what was said. But Mr. Sonnenfeld sent me the results of a survey he took electronically during the event, and they are eye-opening.

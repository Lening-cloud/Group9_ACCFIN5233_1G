âIâm seriously considering spoiling my ballot paper which would be a first for me. Not impressed with any of them. I used to vote Labour but [Jeremy] Corbyn is so far out on the left, not to mention having shown no real leadership until this election, I wonât be doing that,âÂ 
âTheresa May has refused to stand and debate any of the issues,âÂ 
âThis is still all about Brexit for me,âÂ 
âAs a British voter, and in a âsafeâ Conservative constituency, itâs important to register for me what weâre doing to our Planet as the single major issue for us and our children,âÂ 
âI had never in my life belonged to a political party and I officially joined the Lib Dems after Corbyn said he would not oppose the triggering of article 50. But because for me the most important issue in this election is Brexit and how we define our relationship with Europe going forward, I will vote strategically,âÂ 
âPeople talk about Corbyn being too far to the left, but many of the proposals make quite a lot of sense. Basic services â transport, water, utilities including communications â if these could be provided more efficiently and at lower cost it would go a long way in wealth redistribution,âÂ 
âBritain has voted to leave the EU. Theresa May is the only person strong enough to negotiate a fair deal for the British people,âÂ 
âThis is purely and simply about playing whatever part I can to defeat Brexit: above all, that is what this election is about â¦ In my case then the obvious thing then is to vote for the [Scottish National Party], in the hope that their strength of 50+ MPs at Westminster will provide much of that oppositional buffer to Brexit,âÂ

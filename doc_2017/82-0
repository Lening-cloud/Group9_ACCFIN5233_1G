Standing before political and business leaders in New York last fall, Alexander Nix promised a revolution.
Many companies compete in the market for political microtargeting, using huge data sets and sophisticated software to identify and persuade voters. But Mr. Nixâs little-known firm, Cambridge Analytica, claimed to have developed something unique: âpsychographicâ profiles that could predict the personality and hidden political leanings of every American adult.
âOf the two candidates left in the election, one of them is using these technologies,â Mr. Nix said, referring to Donald J. Trump.
Capitalizing on its work for the man who is now president, Cambridge has pitched potential clients in the United States ranging from MasterCard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Ahead of this yearâs elections in Europe, Mr. Nix is promoting the four-year-old United States-based company abroad, too.
Cambridge Analyticaâs rise has rattled some of President Trumpâs critics and privacy advocates, who warn of a blizzard of high-tech, 
But a dozen Republican consultants and former Trump campaign aides, along with current and former Cambridge employees, say the companyâs ability to exploit personality profiles â âour secret sauce,â Mr. Nix once called it â is exaggerated.
Cambridge executives now concede that the company never used psychographics in the Trump campaign. The technology â prominently featured in the firmâs sales materials and in 
âTheyâve got a lot of really smart people,â said Brent Seaborn, managing partner of TargetPoint, a rival business that also provided voter data to the Trump campaign. âBut itâs not as easy as it looks to transition from being excellent at one thing and bringing it into politics. I think thereâs a big question about whether we think psychographic profiling even works.â
At stake are not merely bragging rights, but also an emerging science that many believe could reshape American politics and commerce. Big data companies already know your age, income, favorite cereal and when you last voted. But the company that can perfect psychological targeting could offer far more potent tools: the ability to manipulate behavior by understanding how someone thinks and what he or she fears.
A voter deemed neurotic might be shown a gun-rights commercial featuring burglars breaking into a home, rather than a defense of the Second Amendment; political ads warning of the dangers posed by the Islamic State could be targeted directly at voters prone to anxiety, rather than wasted on those identified as optimistic.
âYou can do things that you would not have dreamt of before,â said Alexander Polonsky, chief data scientist at Bloom, a consulting firm that offers âemotion analysisâ of social networks and has worked with the center-right Republican Party in France.
âIt goes beyond sharing information,â he added. âItâs sharing the thinking and the feeling behind this information, and thatâs extremely powerful.â
Both conservatives and liberals are eager to harness that power. In Washington, some Democratic operatives are scrambling to develop personality-profiling capabilities of their own. But even as Cambridge seeks to expand its business among conservative groups, questions about its performance have soured many Republicans in Mr. Trumpâs orbit.
Cambridge is no longer in contention to work for Mr. Trump at the Republican National Committee, a company spokesman confirmed, nor is it working for America First Policies, a new nonprofit formed to help advance the presidentâs agenda.
In recent months, the value of Cambridgeâs technology has been debated by technology experts and 
But when asked to name a single race where the firmâs flagship product had been critical to victory, Mr. Nix declined.
âWe bake a cake, itâs got 10 ingredients in it. Psychographics is one of them,â he said. âItâs very difficult to isolate exactly what the impact of that ingredient is.â
Cambridgeâs parent company, the London-based Strategic Communication Laboratories Group, has a long record of trying to understand and influence behavior. Founded in 1993 by a former British adman, the firm has worked for companies and candidates around the world, as well as for government and military clients. SCL has studied Pakistani jihadists for the British government and provided intelligence assessments for American defense contractors in Iran, Libya and Syria, according to company documents obtained by The New York Times.
âTheir approach was seen as serious and focused,â said Mark Laity, chief of strategic communications at NATOâs military headquarters in Europe, who has taken part in NATO-affiliated conferences where SCL has made presentations.
In recent years, the company has moved to exploit the revolution in big data to predict human behavior more precisely, working with scientists from the Cambridge University Psychometrics Center. The United States represented a critical new market. Europe has strict privacy protections that limit the use of personal information, but America is more lightly regulated, allowing the sale of huge troves of consumer data to any company or candidate who can afford them.
In 2013, Cambridge Analytica was created as SCLâs American operation, and the two companies today share many of their roughly 200 employees, several top executives, and offices in New York and Washington.
To develop its profiling system, Cambridge conducts detailed psychological surveys â by phone and online â of tens of thousands of people, differentiating them by five traits, a model widely used by behavioral researchers.
Uniquely, the company claims to be able to extrapolate those findings to millions of other people it has not surveyed, assigning them one of 32 distinct personality types. Cambridge then blends those profiles with commercial data and voting histories, revealing âhidden voter trends and behavioral triggers,â according to a 2016 company brochure.
Those profiles, in turn, would allow campaigns to customize advertising, direct-mail slogans and door-knocking scripts, each calibrated to prod the targeted voter toward â or away from â a candidate.
The promise of psychometrics appealed to Mr. Mercer, a computer scientist who made a fortune helping to lead Renaissance Technologies, a Long Island-based hedge fund. Mr. Mercer and his daughter Rebekah presided over a growing political empire that included millions of dollars in contributions to conservative groups and a stake in Breitbart, whose nationalist and racially antagonistic content prefigured Mr. Trumpâs presidential campaign.
Mr. Mercer became Cambridgeâs principal investor, according to two former employees. (Like several others interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing nondisclosure agreements and the threat of lawsuits.) Mr. Bannon, the familyâs political guru, also advised the company and served as vice president of its board, according to Delaware public records.
Mr. Mercer has never spoken publicly about his policy views in depth, but his giving is eclectic: He has financed anti-Clinton documentaries, right-wing media watchdogs, libertarian think tanks and both Senator Ted Cruz, a religious conservative, and Mr. Trump, a thrice-married nationalist.
âThe genius here is Bob, and the billionaire in this is Bob, and the person with the extreme views of how the world should be is Bob,â said David Magerman, a Renaissance research scientist who was recently suspended after criticizing his bossâs support for Mr. Trump.
In the run-up to the 2014 elections, Breitbart, under Mr. Bannon, 
As the 2016 presidential campaign began, however, Cambridge landed a marquee political client: Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator. Mr. Mercer seeded a super PAC with $11 million to support him.
Cambridge had a talented salesman in Mr. Nix, an Eton-educated SCL director chosen to lead the American effort. Among colleagues, his skills at cajoling clients are legendary. At an office party at a London dog track in the summer of 2015, one young employee offered an affectionate toast.
âHe is so smooth heâll rub shoulders with politicians and their campaigns,â the employee joked, according to a video of the event posted on YouTube, âand, in their face, tell them heâs going to rip them off.â
But Cambridgeâs psychographic models proved unreliable in the Cruz presidential campaign, according to Rick Tyler, a former Cruz aide, and another consultant involved in the campaign. In one early test, more than half the Oklahoma voters whom Cambridge had identified as Cruz supporters actually favored other candidates. The campaign stopped using Cambridgeâs data entirely after the South Carolina primary.
âWhen they were hired, from the outset it didnât strike me that they had a wide breadth of experience in the American political landscape,â Mr. Tyler said.
Ms. Mercer and Mr. Bannon were aggressive advocates for Cambridge. When the campaign disputed a $2.5 million invoice, they lit into Mr. Cruzâs senior campaign team during a conference call, according to the consultant. Cambridge Analytica, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Bannon claimed, was the only thing keeping Mr. Cruz afloat. (The company declined to comment on the exchange, as did a personal spokeswoman for Mr. Bannon and the Mercers.)
After the Cruz campaign flamed out, Mr. Nix persuaded Mr. Trumpâs digital director, Brad Parscale, to try out the firm. Its data products were considered for Mr. Trumpâs critical get-out-the-vote operation. But tests showed Cambridgeâs data and models were slightly less effective than the existing Republican National Committee system, according to three former Trump campaign aides.
Mr. Bannon at one point agreed to expand the companyâs role, according to the aides, authorizing Cambridge to oversee a $5 million purchase of television ads. But after some of them appeared on cable channels in Washington, D.C. â hardly an election battleground â Cambridgeâs involvement in television targeting ended.
In postelection conversations with potential clients, Cambridge has promoted itself as the brains behind Mr. Trumpâs upset victory. One brochure circulated to clients this year, which details Cambridgeâs expertise in behavioral targeting, also calls the companyâs âpivotal roleâ in electing Mr. Trump its âbiggest success politically in the United States.â
Trump aides, though, said Cambridge had played a relatively modest role, providing personnel who worked alongside other analytics vendors on some early digital advertising and using conventional microtargeting techniques. Later in the campaign, Cambridge also helped set up Mr. Trumpâs polling operation and build turnout models used to guide the candidateâs spending and travel schedule. None of those efforts involved psychographics.
In some recent public settings, Cambridge executives have acknowledged that. âI donât want to break your heart; we actually didnât do any psychographics with the Trump campaign,â Matt Oczkowski, Cambridgeâs head of product, said 
The firmâs claims about its client base have also shifted. As recently as October, the firm said it had 50 
The spokesman also said neither Cambridge nor SCL had done any work, paid or unpaid, with the pro-âBrexitâ Leave.eu campaign last year, although 
At a conference in Munich last month, Alexander Tayler, Cambridgeâs chief data officer, dodged a question about whether Cambridge would work with far-right parties in European elections this year. He also played down the role of psychological profiling in the companyâs work, much of which, Mr. Tayler suggested, is still based on traditional data analytics and marketing.
âItâs not about being sinister,â Mr. Tayler said. âItâs not about tricking people into voting for a candidate who they wouldnât otherwise support. Itâs just about making marketing more efficient.â
Even before the election, according to one former employee, Cambridge employees attended sessions about soliciting government business in the United States â where Mr. Trump now oversees the federal bureaucracy and Mr. Bannon is arguably the White Houseâs most powerful staff member. According to documents obtained by The Times, SCL is pursuing work for at least a dozen federal agencies, including the Commerce Department and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Mr. Bannonâs spokeswoman said he stepped down from the Cambridge board in August, when he joined the Trump campaign, and âhas no financial involvementâ with the firm currently. She declined to say whether Mr. Bannon previously held equity in the firm.
Late last month, SCL executives met with Pentagon officials who advise the Joint Chiefs of Staff on information warfare. A reference document submitted in advance of that meeting indicates that the company has worked as a subcontractor on roughly a dozen Pentagon projects, many of them âcounter-radicalizationâ assessments in Pakistan and Yemen.
Such intelligence work is the bread and butter of SCLâs government contracting in other countries. And the firmâs experience in trying to influence Muslim sentiment abroad dovetails with Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannonâs focus on combating the Islamic State.

In an email, a Joint Chiefs spokesman confirmed that the Pentagon meeting, 
At the moment, according to former employees, Cambridge has relatively few well-known corporate clients in the United States. Among them are ECI New York, a clothing company, and Goldline, which sells gold coins and markets heavily to listeners of conservative talk radio.
A spokesman for MasterCard declined to say if it would do business with Cambridge. The Yankees did not sign on.
But Mr. Nix appears to have bigger ambitions. âI think were are on the cusp of something enormous,â he said.
Data science is about to reshape marketing, Mr. Nix maintained, and the big advertising conglomerates would survive only by developing their own targeting technology â or acquiring companies like Cambridge.
âThose agencies that donât adapt will die,â Mr. Nix said.

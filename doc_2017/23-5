The British, sleepwalking into what Will Hutton of The Guardian has called âa national act of self-harm on an epic scale,â have voted to be near ungovernable â a condition in which the enfeebled Prime Minister Theresa May claims she can offer â
The epic self-harm is, of course, Britainâs planned exit by 2019 from the European Union, the foundation of its prosperity and strategic heft over more than four decades. The self-inflicted mess stems from the prime ministerâs humiliation in an election 
An inept campaign saw May promising â
May has been repudiated for her arrogance, but above all for her utter vacuity. Almost single-handedly she revived the Labour Party of the leftist Jeremy Corbyn, who 
May was for remaining in the Union before she was against it; at which point all she could say was â
The Conservative Party through a double own-goal â first the needless Brexit referendum and then Mayâs needless snap election â has delivered the country to polarization. The political center has evaporated. The extremes, and The Daily Mail, have won. Economic downturn, fueled by uncertainty, is almost sure to follow.
Together, Britain and the United States have succumbed to a strange delusion of restored greatness, symbolized by Mayâs embrace of Donald Trump. It is the alliesâ un-finest hour. They have turned inward; they have turned nasty. Trumpâs planned visit to Britain later this year, a sop to his vainglory that revealed British desperation at the loss of Europe, is

Still, itâs what the people, or at least a narrow majority, wanted. That has to be respected, unless the people change their mind.
Mayâs other mantra was, âNo deal for Britain is better than a bad deal.â Thatâs off the table, unless Ireland along with British prosperity is to be sacrificed on the Brexit altar. The 
The prime minister will also have to listen more to Conservatives, like Ken Clarke, who have opposed a hard Brexit. She will have to accept that the E.U. is going to exact a price for this decision: Britain cannot have its cake and eat it. If the country wants to remain in the single market, overwhelmingly in its interest, it will have to accept free movement of people, but then, as Hugo Dixon 
Weak and wobbly means weak and wobbly. May could well fall within the next two years, possibly leading to another election. A parliament that is restive may reject any deal she does cobble together. Buyersâ regret was evident in the Labour surge. It is no longer wishful thinking to believe such regret could yet lead to a second referendum, based this time on real terms rather than wretched lies.

Investors also tend to push up the cost of insuring against a British debt default relative to Germany, and compress the gap between the yields of two- and 10-year British government notes.
As a result, the Breakingviews index fell sharply in the months after the referendum in June 2016, in which Britons voted to leave the European Union. The index has since clawed back some ground, though, not least because growth has proved far more resilient than most investors and policy makers expected.
Yet the chances are that the gauge will fall in the months ahead.

Indeed, investors may be underestimating how closely political divorces can match real ones for bitterness and damage.

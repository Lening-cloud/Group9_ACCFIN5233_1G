As an international institute under Swiss law, the forum brings together leaders — including government delegations from over 70 countries in 2017 — to solve problems every country faces in one form or another.
This includes curbing the excesses of globalization, such as income inequality, which we first warned about in this newspaper in 1996, and challenges like climate change or the robot revolution, which without coordinated action could harm humanity catastrophically.
A belief in nation states and in nations working together in the global self-interest is not mutually exclusive. The failures of neoliberalism have placed the social democratic model at grave risk. The simple slogans of populism may be tempting for the likes of Mr. Johnson, but they are no match for the complex challenges we face. These will only be solved by a fundamental reconsideration of capitalism that places people, rather than profit, at its beating heart.

Minutes before Donald J. Trump took the oath of office on Friday, Fox News announced that Nigel Farage, the right-wing British politician, would join the network as a paid on-air contributor. The move provides an unlikely American megaphone for Mr. Farage, a chief architect of the campaign in Britain to leave the European Union and a friend of Mr. Trump, who can now command the audience of the countryâs most-watched cable-news network.
Mr. Farage, the former head of the United Kingdom Independence Party, is one of Europeâs leading proponents of nationalism, and his appointment comes at the start of a year of critical elections in Europe, where right-wing groups are mounting significant bids for power.
It also showcases the extent to which Fox News has become a friendly venue for Mr. Trump and his circle, with stars like Sean Hannity and Bill OâReilly offering daily affirmations of the new president. The network brought on Steve Hilton, another leading proponent of the so-called Brexit, as a contributor last month.

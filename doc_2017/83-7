Bill McKibben’s message in “
We can’t instantly remove the carbon dioxide we are pouring into the atmosphere, cool and de-acidify the oceans, or refreeze the polar regions. We are creating conditions that will persist for eons, and the consequences will be catastrophic.
When will we recognize the urgency before us? While we dismiss the increase in tornadoes, hailstorms and forest fires as “weather events” and ignore the inexorable rise in sea levels, they serve as nature’s gentle but persistent warning of the cataclysm that awaits us.
For our children’s sake, we had better wake up and change course soon.

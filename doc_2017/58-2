It’s hard not to be intrigued.
I’m here interviewing American and Australian military officials for a story about the status of that alliance, but as a first-time visitor to Darwin and the Northern Territory more generally, I’m struck by the degree to which this place feels like 
The fact that Darwin is geographically closer to Jakarta than Sydney; the fact that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up 29 percent of the Northern Territory’s population, compared with 2.4 percent of the country’s population over all; the fact that it’s at the center of a military apparatus that includes air cover, naval assets and — for the next six months, 1,250 American marines — all make Darwin unlike any place I’ve ever visited.
Right now, as I write, I can see a red oil tanker and a gray naval destroyer floating in the jellyfish-and-croc-infested 
Did I mention the blue-eyed Australian struggling to teach a couple from somewhere in Southeast Asia the meaning of “easy come, easy go”? Or the Aboriginal art that may or may not be authentic? Or the fantastic Vietnamese food?
Unpacking the meaning of all this is clearly going take some assistance. This place looks to me like a hothouse theater for many of the issues we hope to explore more deeply in Australia — especially Australian identity and Australia’s sense of its place in the world; and its relationship to the land and its history.
Darwin and the territory appear to have much to teach. And so I’m curious: For those of you who know this place better than I do, 
Email me at nytaustralia@nytimes.com with a story or experience that captures the meaning of this place for you, and I’ll share some of your responses in the next newsletter.

So here’s a fun thing you can’t do every day — see bushrangers getting captured.
Michael Maher, an NYT Australia reader and a fellow journalist, was driving through rural New South Wales a few weeks ago, and saw a sign in Braidwood for an 
In any case, it’s the 150th anniversary of their arrest and Braidwood (“a quintessential rural town with a compelling history dating back to the gold rush,” Michael says) is going flat out. There will be 20 local actors involved and more than 300 shots fired (blanks of course) as part of the re-enactment on Sat. April 29. The fun starts at 2:30 p.m.
I’ve just started “True History of the Kelly Gang” so if I can make it to Braidwood, I shall.

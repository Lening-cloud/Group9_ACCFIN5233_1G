When Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, stands in front of the annual gathering of his partyâs activists next week, he can be confident that his speech will have at least one applause line: He is the politician who took on Uber.
On Friday morning, Transport for London, the not-for-profit company that runs and regulates transport in the capital, made the surprise announcement that Uber, the company that likes to call itself a âridesharing app,â would not have its license to operate in London 
Mr. Khan immediately released a statement supporting the decision, saying that all London businesses needed to â
Last year, when the Labour leader claimed he had to sit on the floor of a âram-packedâ train, and used the opportunity to call for the renationalization of Britainâs railways, it led to 
Mr. Khan, meanwhile, will find this infusion of political capital particularly useful; he backed an unsuccessful challenge to Mr. Corbynâs leadership last summer. Until earlier this week, he had not been given a slot to speak to the partyâs 
Even so, this move is not without risk for the London mayor. Around

They complain that the traditional cabs are uncomfortable, expensive and belch diesel fumes into a city with air quality problems. Cabbies also have a reputation for being grumpy and unhelpful â something that Uber drivers, who are given a star rating by every customer, cannot afford to be.
But those same Londoners are also quietly impressed by the way Transport for London runs the capitalâs transport network â you can tell, because they donât constantly grumble about it. (Actually 
How the London vs. Uber saga plays out will be an important test of Britainâs mood â and will give clues to its future political direction. There is a feeling in the air that regulators should stand up to businesses that simply ignore any rules they donât like. Even among Conservatives, free market fundamentalism is out of fashion. Britons are no longer so in love with âdisruptionâ that we are prepared to overlook the consequences to job security and quality of life it can entail. Perhaps voters have decided that the slogan that galvanized the Brexit vote â â

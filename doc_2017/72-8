His version at City Ballet, featuring more than 150 dancers and musicians, as well as two casts of students from the company-affiliated School of American Ballet, is grandly named âGeorge Balanchineâs The Nutcracker.â
Itâs not as if you could mistake his 1954 gem for anyone elseâs. The children are both scrupulous and full of wide-eyed innocence. The Snowflake Waltz, with its onstage blizzard, is a choreographic wonder. And as for that glorious tree? It weighs one ton and grows from 12 to 40 feet. Back in the day, even as costs for his âNutcrackerâ were skyrocketing, Balanchine wouldnât budge: The ballet, he insisted, 
âThree flops in a row, up to your eyeballs in debt,â the character Ebenezer Scrooge taunts Charles Dickens, mired in writerâs block, as he stares at a sign promising his next story â a tale about Christmas â above an empty stand in a London bookstore window. âIâd think youâd be glad of some advice.â

Anne Truittâs otherworldly but deeply humane wooden monoliths are unmistakable demonstrations of the positive value of restraint. You canât see every one of the 20 or so layers of paint that went into a piece like the nearly seven-foot tall, golden yellow âSummer Remembered,â but it shimmers distinctly with the artistâs focused concentration.
With the exception of three years in Tokyo in the late 1960s, Truitt (1921-2004) spent her working life in Washington, D.C.

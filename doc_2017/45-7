Lincoln. A fitting subject for Presidents’ Day weekend, and we’ve got two books that feature our 16th president. In fiction: George Saunders’s much anticipated debut novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo.” And in nonfiction: “Six Encounters with Lincoln,” a new perspective on the president by the historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor, who sadly died prior to the book’s publication. Two other timely books were written with young readers in mind — a new biography of Frederick Douglass and another of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. It’s books like these that inspire.

Here’s a preview of Andrew’s column on Davos and Mr. Trump, assuming that the president will still leave Washington for the Swiss Alps:
It is both speed-dating at high altitude for the cognoscenti and a cerebral high-minded affair filled with panel conversations around issues such as gender diversity, harassment, artificial intelligence and the environment. The official theme this year is “Creating a shared future in a fractured world.”
All of which makes Mr. Trump the anti-Davos Man.
“Trump is as loathed by the elites of Western Europe as he is by the elites of Manhattan,” said Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution, at Stanford University and a longtime Davos attendee who is taking this year off.
Meanwhile, Davos Men and Women are thinking about

The statement is part of a legal settlement that Mr. Ford reached over the weekend with Morgan Stanley, according to a person who was briefed on the resolution but was not authorized to speak publicly. The broader contours of the settlement were unclear, including whether there was a financial component. Through a spokesman, Mr. Ford declined to comment.
Before his firing last month, Mr. Ford had spent seven years at Morgan Stanley recruiting clients. He joined the investment banking industry after losing a United States Senate race in Tennessee as the Democratic nominee in 2006.
Mr. Ford, 47, was fired after a female journalist told Morgan Stanley that he had harassed her at a dinner in 2014. At the time, Morgan Stanley said he had been fired “for conduct inconsistent with our values and in violation of our policies.” Some media reports of his firing said it had been triggered by the harassment allegation.
Since Mr. Loeb’s Third Point emerged as an investor in the Swiss food giant, Nestlé has sold off its U.S. confectionary business, named new directors and bought Blue Bottle coffee.
All of those have been great moves, according to the hedge fund. But there’s more to be done, Third Point wrote in its latest letter to investors.
From the investor letter:
These actions are important steps in the right direction that make it clear that Nestlé is responding to calls for action. While we recognize that Nestlé has certain unique cultural and structural constraints, we hope now that Dr. Schneider has completed his first year and there is new blood on the Board, the company is able to move with greater alacrity.
• Better demonstrate that the company is focused on “nutrition, health and wellness,” with the implication being to divest products like ice cream and frozen pizza.
• Buy back more shares.
• Again consider selling the L’Oreal stake, something Nestlé has been loath to do historically.

More from the article by Michael Kranish of the WaPo:
“All I know is that we are not at all concerned, and we are cooperating,” Kushner said in a half-hour interview at his headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue. “And they can knock themselves out for the next 10 years reading those papers as far as I’m concerned.”
The elder Mr. Kushner also lamented the amount of criticism that his son, a senior presidential adviser, has taken:
“I try not to focus in my life on the haters but it’s just, I have never seen anything like this,” Kushner said.

The tax overhaul signed into law last month is muddying the fourth-quarter earnings picture.
Improving corporate profit have been a pillar of the current rally, and analysts have forecast robust earnings growth in the coming months as the global economy gained momentum.
Yet with 11 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported four-quarter results, profits have slipped 0.2 percent from a year ago. That’s well below the 10 percent analysts expected ahead of earnings season.
So what gives? The tax law.
Large financial firms, which have made up the bulk of companies reporting thus far, have taken big one-time, tax-related charges. Profits for financial firms in the S&P 500 fell $29.2 billion, or 57 percent. Citigroup accounted for 73 percent of that decline. John Butters, a senior earnings analyst at FactSet, writes:
“Prior to the earnings release, many analysts had not updated their EPS estimates to reflect the impact of the charge. However, since the majority of analysts covering Citigroup provide EPS estimates to FactSet on a GAAP basis, the tax charge was included in the actual EPS for comparison.”
Exclude Citi, and the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 would improve to 7.9 percent from -0.2 percent.

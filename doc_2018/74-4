The suspects in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and the pipe-bomb mailings shared something in common: They posted reams of hateful messages online. Now the platforms they used are having to reckon with their role.
Gab, an extremist-friendly messaging service used by Robert Bowers, the suspect in the Pittsburgh rampage, 
There are lingering questions about the way Gab, Twitter and Facebook allowed Mr. Bowers and Mr. Sayoc to post messages that decried Jews and others. (“Jews are the children of Satan,” Mr. Bowers’s profile on Gab read. Mr. Sayoc’s Facebook feed overflowed with screeds against Hillary Clinton, Islamist terrorism and illegal immigration.)
Kevin Roose of the NYT writes that mainstream social networks belatedly “have come to realize that an anything-goes approach is ripe for exploitation, and ultimately bad for business.” But Gab appears defiant, 
IBM agreed yesterday to 
Amazon, Microsoft and Google have outpaced IBM in providing cloud services to companies. The Red Hat deal is a bid to fix that, based on a belief that customers won’t want to rely on just one cloud provider: Instead, IBM hopes, businesses will adopt 
It’s an expensive bet. IBM will pay $190 a share for Red Hat, a 60 percent premium over Friday’s closing stock price. But some commentators think the deal makes sense: “Linking arms and fighting the tech giants together

A rout helps investors decide what’s worth really worrying about. With the United States economy growing strongly, they may soon decide they’ve been freaking out too much. A sustained upturn in bank stocks may show that their optimism is returning. But if they remain in the doldrums, real trouble may lie ahead.
But there are other reasons to fear an economic stutter. Commerce Department figures released on Friday show that growth of the U.S. gross domestic product has slowed slightly, and some economists 
Soybeans threatened to overtake corn as the king of America’s crops in recent years, thanks to outsize Chinese demand. But the trade fight between Washington and Beijing may be 
The WSJ points out that Chinese tariffs on soybeans are crimping exports, and prices for oilseeds are down 11 percent this year. America’s biggest rival in soybean farming, Brazil, is also working hard to improve its export infrastructure. More from Jesse Newman and Jacob Bunge:
“You’re not going to raise a crop that you lose $2 a bushel on every year,” said Joel Schreurs, a Minnesota farmer who considers switching up to 30 percent of his soybean acres into corn next year if Chinese duties remain in place and federal assistance dries up.
The shift away from soybeans couldn’t have come at a worse time for some farmers: This year’s yield is expected to be the biggest ever. Farmers who took out debt to bet on soybeans may find themselves unable to afford a quick switch to corn.
Europe’s tough stance on technology companies might be catching on. 
More from Timothy W. Martin and Sam Schechner of the WSJ:
Such taxes, which are separate from corporate income taxes many companies already pay, are broadly known as digital taxes and could add billions of dollars to companies’ tax bills. They seek to impose levies on digital services sold by global companies in a given country from units based outside that country. In some cases, the proposed taxes target services involving the collection of data about local residents, such as targeted online advertising.
Opponents of the taxes worry about double taxation and argue that they could dampen international investment. But while the E.U. proposal has faced criticism, a growing number of similar efforts around the globe may make such taxes more likely.
The master’s in business administration was once almost a prerequisite for climbing the corporate ladder. But more U.S. business schools are dropping the degree, as 70 percent of American institutions reported drops in enrollment in two-year programs, 
Among the possible factors: Online courses offer many of the same skills, and a booming labor market means fewer people want to go back to school. Some people are now bearish about the future of the degree, according to Jonathan Moules and Andrew Jack of the FT:
“I think the M.B.A. has peaked,” says Arnoud de Meyer, former dean of Insead, Europe’s highest ranked school, and now president of Singapore Management University. “There were a few very good years in the U.S. in the 1980s. Then with the emergence of European M.B.A.s there was an explosion of the good, the bad and the ugly. Now we have a bit of rationalization.”

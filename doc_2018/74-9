Bloomberg reports that the administration could announce the levies by early December, to take effect by early February. (The plan is said to be a backup, in case a meeting next month between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China doesn’t yield results.) The tariffs could cover about $257 billion worth of goods — including popular items like iPhones and Nike sneakers.
That means American shoppers could feel 
The Trump administration made another move to check Beijing’s tech ambitions: It blocked Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, a semiconductor maker, 
The decision, which came after the American chip maker Micron accused Jinhua of intellectual property theft, could be a crippling blow to the Chinese company. (And it drew comparisons to the Trump administration’s harsh actions against ZTE earlier this year.) The penalties will delay China’s effort to establish a homegrown chip industry that doesn’t rely on American parts.
Experts said that the move sets

Behind that volatility were continuing investor concerns that tech stocks are overvalued. Amazon, for instance, fell 6.3 percent yesterday, while Netflix dropped 5 percent, and shares in both are down over 20 percent this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.6 percent on Monday, and is off 13 percent from its August high.
Trade fears also weighed on stocks, after a report that President Trump may impose tariffs on all remaining imports from China, raising fears about increasing costs for American businesses and consumers.
U.S. markets are looking stronger this morning, however, with futures for major indexes up.
In the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, social media is coming under close scrutiny. So far, its progress is found wanting.
Robert Bowers, the suspect in the Pittsburgh rampage, posted reams of hateful messages online. But 
More from Sheera Frenkel, Mike Isaac and Kate Conger:
Over the last 10 years, Silicon Valley’s social media companies have expanded their reach and influence to the furthest corners of the world. But it has become glaringly apparent that the companies never quite understood the negative consequences of that influence nor what to do about it — and that they cannot put the genie back in the bottle.
The biggest platforms, like Facebook, Google and Twitter, say that they are working to unearth hateful content, using human moderators and software. (Some employees worry that’s still not enough.) But Gab, an extremist-friendly messaging service Mr. Bowers used, is 
The British government announced plans yesterday to introduce a 
The chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, announced the initiative as part of the nation’s annual budget. The new charge, scheduled to go into effect in 2020, would apply only to organizations with global revenue of at least 500 million pounds, or about $640 million. The government will ask for 2 percent of revenue the companies generate in Britain. Mr. Hammond said the plan could eventually raise as much as £400 million annually.
But the tech industry is unimpressed. The Information Technology Industry Council, which represents the likes of Google and Facebook, said that “imposing a digital tax could create a chilling effect on investment in the U.K. and hinder businesses of all sizes from creating jobs.”
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said yesterday that 
Ms. Merkel’s retreat, analysts say, could mark the beginning of a new era not just for Europe’s biggest country but for the Continent itself.
It could leave Germany more unstable and less able to take the lead in Europe at a time when leadership is badly needed on an array of topics — from Britain’s imminent departure from the European Union to Italy’s controversial budget plans.
Stefan Koopman, an economist at Rabobank, offered a bleak assessment to the NYT: “There couldn’t be a worse time for Germany’s steady ship to hit choppy waters.”

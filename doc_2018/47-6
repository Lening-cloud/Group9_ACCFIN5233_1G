Uber and Lyft compete aggressively in the American ride-hailing market. And now that competition could extend into a battle for investors as the companies push for stock market debuts in 2019.
Uber’s probable lead underwriters, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, told the company that it 
The first to go public would get dibs on investors eager for a piece of the ride-hailing business. That could be especially important for Lyft, given that its I.P.O. would most likely be swamped by its much bigger rival’s, whose offering would be the biggest to hit the market since Alibaba’s in 2014.
Success may be outside either company’s control, though, given the state of stock markets and investor skepticism over whether the valuations being offered

Positive earnings reports, including from Goldman Sachs and Netflix, were factors, as were strong economic data, which showed a fourth straight month of industrial production gains and job openings at a record high.

Investors 
The ratio for the companies in the S.&P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix’s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It’s so much larger because investors expect Netflix’s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.
That level of investor risk-taking could augur well for the stock market, Mr. Eavis writes — but may evaporate if another big tech company, like Facebook, delivers disappointing earnings.
Pressure continues to build on Saudi Arabia in the wake of the disappearance and suspected killing of a prominent Saudi journalist. Yesterday, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a longtime ally of the Saudis, said the U.S. should “
But Prince Mohammed has close ties with President Trump, who 
To make the strategy work, the administration is counting on its relationship with the Saudis to keep global oil flowing without spiking prices, and to work together on a new policy to contain Iran in the Persian Gulf.
Richard Haas of the Council on Foreign Relations summed up the fine line Mr. Trump must walk: “It’s a neat trick if you can both sanction a country and partner with them at the same time.”
A federal judge 
Judge Alison Nathan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said that the settlements were “fair, reasonable and will serve the interests of the public and investors.” She did not mention Mr. Musk’s more recent Twitter antics, such as a tweet where he appeared to call the agency the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission.”
Google has always made its Android operating system available for free. It’s a way to get its apps on as many devices as possible, and to collect data about users and sell advertising. But in Europe, it will now charge handset manufacturers to install apps like Gmail and Google Maps.
It’s a response to a European antitrust ruling in July that hit Google with a roughly $5 billion fine for unfairly bundling free Android services to maintain its market dominance. (Google is appealing the decision, but it faced a deadline by which it had to change operations or risk further punishment.)
The ultimate effect of the change announced on Tuesday remains to be seen, but European customers will probably see a wider variety of Android devices to choose from. Some will come with Google’s services; others may more prominently feature applications made by competitors.
Beijing has tried to rein in ballooning debt in its financial system, but it may have a new problem: A new report by Standard & Poor’s finds that Chinese local governments may have 
“The potential amount of debt is an iceberg with titanic credit risks,” S.&P. credit analysts led by Gloria Lu wrote in a report Tuesday. Much of the buildup relates to local government financing vehicles, which don’t necessarily have the full financial backing of local governments themselves.
That may be a big worry: China’s economy has slowed and defaults have risen this year. Beijing could struggle to contain this latest debt bubble.

â¢ $61.6 billion â Revenue from iPhone sales, up 13 percent from a year earlier.
âApple has long followed Mies van der Roheâs design precept that âless is more.â Now itâs doing the same financially. The company sold fewer iPhones for more money in the last quarter, it reported on Thursday. That raises fears that the company is losing its innovation edge. But thatâs OK â persuading customers to pay more arguably requires as much genius as getting people to adopt the technology in the first place.â
Amazon.com is going gangbusters. But some of the nearly $700 billion internet retailerâs fastest-expanding â and most profitable â businesses could be ones that irritate users. Over time, that could sully the companyâs image.
Alphabet is stuck at the letter G. The holding company of Google was created to safeguard against conventionality and let moonshot ideas, like self-driving cars, flourish. Almost three years in, itâs basically still just Google. Which means, in turn, that the A in Alphabet stands mainly for advertising.
It wouldnât hurt Alphabet to put more energy into revenue sources that donât start with a G.

â¢ Walt Disneyâs deal for much of 21st Century Fox late last year has sparked much strategic rethinking across the industry. Ms. Redstone believes that CBS and Viacom need greater scale to better compete with Disney, Netflix and Amazon.
âCBS isnât safe from the industryâs broad ratings pressure and subscriber declines, which is why scale is important. Viacom wonât provide enough of it, but it will offer substantial cost-saving opportunities. Those synergies may amount to some $500 million based on what past deals have yielded, according to Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. That could create quite a lift for CBSâs earnings.â
Belinda Johnson is moving up. Laurence Tosi is moving out. And donât expect the company to go public this year.
Airbnb has hired a search firm to find a new C.F.O. Ellie Mertz, the companyâs head of global financial planning, will fill in that role on an interim basis.

Airbnb is heading ever so slowly toward an initial public offering. 
Hereâs Mr. Chesky on Ms. Johnson:
âShe takes critical functions that might be seen as constraints in other companies, and clears a path so they can become competitive advantages and facilitate the growth of the business.â
And hereâs a statement from Eric Holder, the former U.S. Attorney General who has been advising the company on anti-discrimination policies:
âHaving worked with Belinda over the years and at Airbnb, I have been consistently impressed by her ability to anticipate issues and leverage strategic opportunities. She combines technical expertise with great care for her colleagues.â
And hereâs Mr. Chesky on Mr. Tosi:
âHe helped Airbnb establish a rigorous financial discipline, aided our expansion into new businesses including into luxury rentals, which is now one of our core businesses, and helped us develop new and innovative ways to grow Airbnb and our businesses.â
Some of the most consequential battles in the world of technology are playing out in Europe, where governments are cracking down on tech giants like Google and Facebook.
Facebookâs quarterly results, released Wednesday, provide crucial information for better understanding the balance of power between Silicon Valley titans and the democracies of Europe.
The results clearly showed the importance of the European market to Facebookâs future growth. The companyâs average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada.
Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europeâs economy is only a bit smaller than the United Statesâ, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower.
All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada.
What does this mean for Facebook as European countries introduce measures aimed at 
Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europeâs leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebookâs bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond.

More from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:
Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex.
âThis became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,â said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. âIt could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.â

While a potential joint venture between Alphabet and Aramco isnât necessarily connected to the latter companyâs IPO, if a deal is struck before the offering, advisers to the company could pitch the pact as a way for investors to bake in technology valuations.

Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.
Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.

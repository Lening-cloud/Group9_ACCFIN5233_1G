In 2014, James Katzman, then leading Goldman’s West Coast M.&A. practice, called the firm’s whistle-blower hotline. Colleagues, he said, had tried repeatedly to obtain and share confidential client information. But an NYT report reveals that instead of being investigated by outside lawyers, his allegations were 
Here’s how Emily Flitter, Kate Kelly and Dave Enrich describe his role:
During the meetings, Mr. Solomon repeatedly recommended that Mr. Katzman let go of his grievances and focus instead on his job, said the people close to Mr. Katzman. Mr. Solomon told Mr. Katzman that the concerns he had raised simply reflected the way Wall Street worked, these people said.
Mr. Katzman perceived Mr. Solomon as trying to silence him, the people said. A person at Goldman said that was not Mr. Solomon’s intent.
Mr. Katzman left the firm in 2015 and signed a confidentiality agreement. Goldman’s board will hear about Mr. Solomon’s interactions with Mr. Katzman at a scheduled board meeting tomorrow.
Apple will unveil its latest batch of products today at its Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, Calif.
Today won’t just feature iPhones, however. A larger Apple Watch could make an appearance, as could updated wireless AirPod earbuds. And Apple’s wireless charging station could finally be announced. Less likely are a replacement for the MacBook Air, an update to the iPad Pro, or even a new Mac Mini desktop.
Expect some software announcements as well, and perhaps an update on content.
Many companies across America have complained about the White House’s tariffs on imported goods. Now a huge (and eclectic) group of them — from energy industry groups to Maine lobstermen — have created 
More from Brody Mullins and Andrew Duehren of the WSJ:
“Every sector of the U.S. economy stands to lose in a trade war,” said Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation. The goal of the campaign is to “ensure Washington understands the real-world consequences of a trade war.”
Some of the campaign’s efforts are addressed to Republican lawmakers in politically vital states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. But 
Gary Shapiro of the Consumer Technology Association told Reuters: “The sugar high of the lower taxes and the reduced rules that have fueled the stock market since the president was elected are in jeopardy.”
The blockchain industry now has a voice on Capitol Hill. The WaPo reports that several cryptocurrency companies, including Coinbase and Circle, have formed the Blockchain Association, 
It plans to represent entrepreneurs and investors involved in blockchain-based products and services. And it appears to have learned from the last big wave of hot-ticket tech companies, like Uber and Airbnb. “We’re not companies looking to game the system,” Mike Lempres, Coinbase’s chief legal and risk officer, told the WaPo, “but trying to develop a legal and regulatory system that’ll stand the test of time.”
What they want to discuss with lawmakers first: tax law and how regulations like anti-money-laundering rules apply to the industry.
Wall Street’s longest-serving C.E.O. is starting to take more of a back seat. Having led JPMorgan Chase since 2005, Mr. Dimon is delegating more control of the $2.6 trillion firm to his lieutenants.
JPMorgan named two co-presidents, Gordon Smith and Daniel Pinto, earlier this year. Now, he’s letting them do more of the legwork. Mr. Dimon told the FT, “When you have Tom Bradys on the field, 
It’s another sign that he intends to step down when his contract is up in five years. Whoever takes over — probably Mr. Smith, Mr. Pinto or JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake — will have big shoes to fill. A rival banking chief told the FT: “
Markets in Argentina, Turkey, Russia and South Africa are in free-fall. America’s rising interest rates and strengthening dollar often get the blame, as indebted emerging economies struggle to repay dollar-denominated debt. 
The correlation between [emerging market] risk assets and the Fed funds rate is not that tight. In fact, there have only been two episodes since 1980 when emerging markets cratered as U.S. interest rates ticked higher.
What’s more, the FT continues, “E.M. stocks and currencies have been more likely to perform well as the Fed tightened monetary policy.” (Its preferred culprit for the problems is a slowdown in the Chinese economy.)

The level of interest rates, the reliance on foreign borrowers, refinancing needs, the size of government deficits and the stockpiles of foreign currency that can be used to push back market pressures all play a role.

“You don’t have the answer to the questions, where did you come from? What is life all about? Where are you going when you die? You don’t have those answers yet. You can find it tonight.” Billy Graham is probably the most important evangelist of the 20th century, even though American history is populated with prominent Christian preachers who were pivotal figures in their times. But Billy Graham combined his personal magnetism and his clear message with the foresight to make use of modern communications technologies. Everything from television to satellite uplinks to the internet. “— of God’s mighty love. When I go abroad, I don’t go as an ambassador of the United States, I go as an ambassador of the king of kings and Lord of Lords.” Billy Graham pioneered global crusades, and his sermons were transmitted simultaneously into dozens of languages — “Be repentant of your sins before.” — and transmitted by satellite to hundreds of countries. So he had a global reach. “Christianity is not a white man’s religion, and don’t let anybody ever tell you that it’s white or black. Christ belongs to all people.” Billy Graham was not only charismatic and telegenic, but he understood that no matter how large the crowd, he had to move each man and woman there personally. “Is your heart right?” And he would speak in a way that was accessible. “— be Lord of your eyes, Lord of your ears —” People who attended Billy Graham crusades would often say afterward, I felt like he was speaking to me personally. “I’m going to ask you to get up from your seat if you —” Thousands of people, many first-time converts, would stream forward and be met by representatives of local churches, so that after the crusade was over, they would have a local church to be part of. And in this way, Billy Graham had a huge impact on building evangelical Christianity. “The spirit at large comes to live within you —” He wasn’t building just his own movement or his own church. He was building Christianity. “I’m looking forward to that day when I’ll see Christ face to face. Are you?”

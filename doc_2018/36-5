More from Andrew and Kate Kelly of the NYT about how this played out:
Over the weekend, Mr. Dimon consulted by telephone with two other powerful Wall Street executives, the head of BlackRock, Laurence D. Fink, and Blackstone Groupâs chief, Stephen Schwarzman, said two people familiar with the conversations. All three depend on the kingdom for revenue.
Mr. Dimon, Mr. Fink and Mr. Schwarzman pressed Saudi officials to postpone the event, the two people said. The three executives and their staffs reached out to the Treasury Department and urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to press for the event to be postponed or to publicly make his attendance conditional on more disclosure from the Saudis about Mr. Khashoggiâs disappearance.
Mr. Dimonâs decision follows those of Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber, Bill Ford of Ford Motor and other C.E.O.s. At issue: the disappearance and possible murder of the Saudi exile Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdomâs consulate in Istanbul. Saudi officials deny any involvement.

The original everything store, Sears has struggled to compete against Amazon and other online retailers in the past decade. Its C.E.O., the financier Eddie Lampert, has tried several strategies to revive its fortunes. All have failed. Mr. Lampert has also faced criticism for 
Alongside the bankruptcy filing, Mr. Lampert stepped down as Searsâs C.E.O. but will remain chairman. The retailer will close at least 142 stores, and lenders have given it $300 million in loans to keep operating through bankruptcy proceedings, with the aim of preserving the company at least through the holidays.
But that lifeline may not be enough for Sears to fix itself and avoid liquidation.
Stock markets around the world took a battering last week, as a confluence of factors â nascent inflation, rising interest rates, tightening fiscal policy and trade tensions â spooked investors. Overnight, Asian markets dropped, while European ones held their ground.
But over the coming days, the markets will either be shored up or shaken further, as companies report quarterly earnings results. As 
What to look out for:
â¢ Bank earnings are expected to be strong, rising by as much as 41 percent, according to numbers from Refinitiv.
â¢ Energy companies are expected to do well, with profits potentially more than doubling from a year ago.
â¢ Industrial companies may fare worse, as their supply chains take a hit from the extra costs of tariffs.
Confidential documents reviewed by the NYT suggest that Jared Kushner, President Trumpâs son-in-law and adviser, appears to have 
How did he do it? By deducting a portion of the cost of his buildings from his taxable income every year as depreciation â a common tax-minimizing maneuver that allows paper losses to offset earnings. An example: In 2015, Mr. Kushner took home $1.7 million in salary and investment gains. But those earnings were swamped by $8.3 million in losses, largely because of âsignificant depreciation.â (Hereâs a 
Nothing in the documents suggests Mr. Kushner broke the law, and a spokesman for his lawyer said that he âpaid all taxes due.â

Discussion about Britainâs withdrawal from the European Union hit an impasse last night. Dominic Raab, the countryâs Brexit secretary, told his European counterpart, Michel Barnier, that his government could not agree to the blocâs current terms, with Prime Minister Theresa May having called a draft a ânonstarter.â
The 
E.U. leaders may conclude there is not sufficient progress to justify proceeding to a special Brexit summit in November to seal a deal, leaving talks in limbo and Britain heading towards an economically damaging âno dealâ exit next March.

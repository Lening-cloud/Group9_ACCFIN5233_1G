Mr. Musk spoke with Mark Cuban, an entrepreneur who had his own battles with the S.E.C., before reversing his decision to settle.
The deal means that Mr. Musk wonât risk being banned from serving as an executive or director of a public company, and came about under pressure from lawyers and shareholders. (Teslaâs shares plummeted on Friday, giving short sellers $1.3 billion in profit.)
But how much will really change?
Investors express hope that new board members will force Mr. Musk to focus on solving 
But critics 
The companyâs policing of Mr. Muskâs communications with the outside world may be the largest change, given how much trouble his tweets have caused. But little has changed so far: He

The deal â which will now be called the âUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreementâ â includes big concessions:
â¢ Canada will ease protections on its dairy industry and give the U.S. more access to its markets.
â¢ The U.S. wonât eliminate an independent tariff dispute system or impose auto tariffs on Canada. (Aluminum and steel ones may remain, though.)
Sundayâs breakthrough came after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada became involved in the talks over the weekend. He even asked Mexico, which had already reached an accord with the U.S., to intervene.
Both sides see this as a win. But President Trump may celebrate most: As the WSJ notes, it shows his administration

Facebook will come under intense scrutiny for the hacking â especially in the E.U., whose tough new General Data Protection Regulation can inflict big fines if a company did not do enough to safeguard user data. The WSJ explains that the social network could face 
The hacking is another headache for Facebook. The company has been buffeted over the last year by scandals including the abuse of user data and the manipulation of the social network for election meddling.
California on Sunday adopted its own net neutrality regulations, after the F.C.C. rescinded its rules last year. Hours later, Justice Department officials 
Californiaâs new laws are tougher than those enacted by the Obama administration. They forbid internet service providers from intentionally slowing web services or blocking online content, and ban them from accepting money to make some services run faster.
The F.C.C. had warned that such efforts could face legal action. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that California had â
More on what it means, from Tony Romm and Brian Fung of the WaPo:
The F.C.C.âs efforts immediately put Washington on a collision course with the states. To start, more than 20 states filed lawsuits against the F.C.C., arguing that the agency had acted arbitrarily in repealing the net neutrality rules. Their efforts have won the support of companies like Mozilla and trade associations representing tech giants including Amazon, Facebook and Google.
The state now requires public companies based there to have a 
About 165 companies will be affected. Facebook and Tesla donât currently comply, for example, and will need at least three women on their board by 2021.
The bill has detractors. Even Gov. Jerry Brown acknowledged that the law could face legal challenges.

Most people remember 2016 for continued economic growth, falling unemployment and continued consumer spending. But Neil Irwin of the Upshot points out that it brought 
There was a sharp slowdown in business investment, caused by an interrelated weakening in emerging markets, a drop in the price of oil and other commodities, and a run-up in the value of the dollar. The pain was confined mostly to the energy and agricultural sectors and to the portions of the manufacturing economy that supply them with equipment.
The mini-recession ended when China let banks borrow more and the Fed held interest rates steady. But Mr. Irwin notes that the dip may have had serious consequences â including making Donald Trumpâs economic message more attractive to those in the affected industries.
Compensation in the start-up scene is often intensely guarded. But the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has compiled industrywide data on pay, based on surveys of executive search firms, and 
â¢ The median salary offer for a C.E.O. role at a Series C consumer products company is $325,000 in cash, with a 50 percent bonus and a 6 percent stock grant.
â¢ The median salary for a senior director of engineering at a young Series A start-up is about $200,000 in cash, with a 0.58 percent stock grant.
Business Insider created interactive charts using the data, and they are worth studying to see how much these workers make â and how companies alter compensation as they get older.

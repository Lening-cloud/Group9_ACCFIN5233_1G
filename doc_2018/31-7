James Dyson is unapologetically British.
The product of the English boarding school system, Mr. Dyson found his calling as an industrial designer and built one of the most successful private companies in the United Kingdom by selling his distinctive vacuums. He was knighted in 2007, served as the provost of the Royal College of Art in London and is one of the countryâs richest men. 
Yet in a globalized economy, Mr. Dyson remains intently focused on what he believes is Britainâs exceptional place in the world. He wistfully refers to the British Empire, and unlike most in the business community, is in favor of Britainâs withdrawal from the European Union, believing Brexit will make the country stronger economically and culturally.
In this interview, Mr. Dyson expressed antiquated and at times offensive views on âracial differencesâ and Japanese culture. He also referred to growth markets in Asia as the âFar East.â When asked to clarify his remarks, Mr. Dyson declined to comment further. (Read a portion of his comments on Japan below.)
Mr. Dyson discovered his passion for design at an early age, and eventually began work on his signature product, the bagless vacuum cleaner. It took several years, but he brought the product to market, founding Dyson Ltd. in 1991. Soon, Dyson was expanding internationally and developing new products, including washing machines, fans, heaters, air purifiers, hand dryers and hair dryers. It is now at work on an electric car.
However Brexit plays out, Mr. Dysonâs company looks like it will endure. It posted a strong jump in sales last year, thanks in large part to 
This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted in New York. 
My father died when I was quite young. He was a teacher at a boarding school, but he didnât have life insurance, so the school allowed my brother and I to continue there. Boarding is pretty harsh stuff. Youâre sent away for 14 weeks, and your parents could visit you one Saturday a term, and that was it. âFeelingsâ is a word I didnât know until I was about 50.
I did art at boarding school, which I really enjoyed. So I decided to go to art school in London. Thatâs where I discovered design and thought, âThatâs what I want to be doing. I want to be designing and creating things.â I started off with architecture, and then I discovered Buckminster Fuller, the great American inventor, entrepreneur. And suddenly, the thing that was interesting me the most was the thing I always thought was incredibly boring, which is engineering.
When I was in college, I went to this industrialist at an engineering company. He said, âIâll give you some design jobs.â He had this idea for this high-speed landing craft for the military and said, âWhy donât you design that?â I knew nothing about boats, though I didnât dare say it, but it sounded fun. So we built a prototype, and then the chairman of the company said, âWell you better start selling it.â
I looked at him slightly blankly and said, âWell, donât I have to do some market research?â And he said, âDonât bother. Itâs a good product. Anyway, youâre the engineer, you know every nut and bolt of the thing.â 
I didnât look like a business man or anything. I had flowing trousers, long hair, flowered shirts. But I set up the company and manufacturing, and I sold them for five years. We sold them to militaries all over the world, to oil companies, construction companies, smugglers bringing American cigarettes into Italy.
He came in a leather jacket and paid cash. I asked him what he was going to do, and I didnât think smuggling cigarettes was particularly naughty. 
The point is, hereâs this longhaired art student in the mid-â60s, getting asked to design something he knew nothing about. Then heâs told to set up a company, which he knew nothing about. Thatâs what I do today with my people. I try to recruit everybody as a graduate, because they have no baggage, they have enthusiasm and curiosity. I think experience can be fine in certain situations and with certain companies. But when youâre doing something very different, itâs often best done by people who have done nothing before.
I decided to pick a modest product and do a completely different version and see what happened. But the retailers werenât interested, because they said it was too different and they said they didnât have space for a different thing made by a nobody. So I decided to advertise in newspapers. And what I learned is that the public wants to buy strange things, as long as thereâs purpose to them. As long as they can see whatâs new and different about it, theyâll buy them. 
I saw the problem, and I saw a possible solution, which was the huge cyclones outside cement plants and timber yards that collect dust all day long. So I started building various versions of that technology. As it happens, it didnât work. I had to spend four or five years coming up with different types of cyclonic separation devices in order to make it work.
It took a lot of empirical work. I had to build the prototypes, one or two a day, which sounds tedious, but actually it was fascinating. Iâm still doing it today. It always is a wonderful adventure of excitement and disappointment. Almost everything you do is a failure, until you get the one success that works.
I was borrowing it all from the bank. Going deeper and deeper into debt. By the time I launched the vacuum cleaner, I was two million pounds in debt. I think the bank got in a bit deeper than they intended to, but I had an interesting bank manager. I asked him why he lent me the money, and he said, âI went home to my wife and said, âWhat do you think about vacuum bags and vacuum cleaners?â And she said, âDreadful, dreadful.ââ
A junior buyer at Best Buy took our vacuum cleaner home and used it for three weeks and came back to her boss and said, âThis actually is a really good vacuum. It doesnât make a mess.â And he said, âAll right, letâs give it a go in 50 shops.â It sold well, and then everybody else wanted it. It was just one brave junior buyer, convincing her manager.
We do a lot of our product launches in Tokyo. Theyâre technology nuts. They love artifacts. 
Whenever we went there, we thought you had to learn to behave like a Japanese person, you know, bowing. What I quickly learned is thatâs not what they wanted from us at all. They wanted our eccentricity and difference. So, I carried on being an Englishman.
Iâve been working on an electric car. We bought an old World War II airfield, so weâve got a place to do it. Tesla proved that people want electric cars, though I donât think governments have realized it yet. People are trying to ignore pollution and the damage that pollution does. Apart from that, the electric car is a much nicer and easier car to own. You donât have to go to gas stations, which arenât very nice.
I donât really look at markets at all. Otherwise, I would have never gone into hand drying. When we have technology we feel could do something interesting, we go into that field. Itâs entirely technology- and product-led. Itâs not led by market size. Hand dryers are not a sexy business, but we had the technology which did it better, and it happens to be a perfectly reasonable business. Itâs not like computers or mobile phones, but we wanted to do it and we enjoyed it. We still enjoy it. I choose unpopular fields to go into, because theyâre more interesting. I want to play the bassoon, please. Playing the guitar is much more sexy, but the bassoon is more interesting.
I think we should be independent. Europe has become more and more of a unified society where all the laws are made in Brussels. I donât believe itâs ever been right for Britain.
Britain has always been a globally facing country, with our empire, if I dare mention that, covering half the globe. We have a pioneering and global outlook. Thereâs no room for us in Europe.
All cars coming into England from America have a 10 percent duty on them, and most of that goes to Brussels. Europe is a protectionist setup designed to keep competitors out. Itâs not a good thing to be in. We believe in free trade. And if any bankers are leaving London, itâs got nothing to do with Brexit. It was the right decision for Britain.

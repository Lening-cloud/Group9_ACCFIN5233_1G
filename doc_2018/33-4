According to many Twitter users on Friday, there was only one option: to channel the actor Hugh Grant, specifically his performance in the romantic comedy âLove Actually.â

A lot of Brits waking up this morning to Trumpâs Sun interview and hoping Theresa May steals a few lines from Hugh Grant in Love Actually, calling the American president a bully and then doing this... 
In the film, Mr. Grant plays a British prime minister who hosts a lecherous American president played by Billy Bob Thornton, and who finally snaps. At a news conference, he is asked about the âspecial relationshipâ between Britain and the United States.
âI fear that this has become a bad relationship â a relationship based on the president taking exactly what he wants and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to, um, Britain,â he says in the movie.
âWe may be a small country, but weâre a great one too,â he adds, to a soundtrack of soaring strings. âA friend who bullies us is no longer a friend. And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward I should be prepared to be much stronger. And the president should be prepared for that.â
Mrs. May, who hosted Mr. Trump at a dinner on Thursday and was meeting with him at the country estate Chequers on Friday, showed no sign of planning a confrontation. But at least one prominent supporter of the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said that he would have done so:
In the film, Mr. Grantâs character ends up falling in love with a junior staff member. Mrs. May has been happily married since 1980.

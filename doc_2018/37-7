âMortal Enginesâ takes place after the âSixty Minute Warâ has brought humanity to the brink, and the worldâs metropolises have escaped from their locations. It is the era of âmunicipal Darwinism,â when âpredator citiesâ rove on wheels and âingestâ smaller ones, assimilating their populations and looting the spoils. In the opening sequence, London devours a Bavarian mining town.
The allegorical potential seems obvious. Do rural areas fear urban domination? Is Brexit involved? (âWe should never have gone into Europe,â frets Magnus Crome, the vaguely imperial ruler of London played by Patrick Malahide.)

Our human points of entry are Tom (Robert Sheehan), the son of historians and a would-be aviator, and Hester (the Icelandic actress Hera Hilmar), who seeks to avenge her motherâs murder by the power-hungry Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). In a refreshingly unfamiliar cast, the most familiar member â apart from Weaving â is an unrecognizable Stephen Lang, as what can only be called an undead cyborg.
Attention has clearly been paid to detail. This is a movie in which St. Paulâs Cathedral houses a nuclear weapon, and product placement overrides any aesthetic. Universal, this filmâs distributor, might be pleased to hear that a dystopian-era London museum has preserved the legacy of 
And while âMortal Enginesâ offers plenty to snicker at, the same might be said of the ancientsâ movie formulas.

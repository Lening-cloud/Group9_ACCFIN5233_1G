President Trump and his policies have alarmed many traditional conservative backers, but many others remain quiet, satisfied with tax cuts and the appointment of conservative judges. Mr. Klarman told Bari Weiss of the NYT’s editorial pages that those points don’t make up for Mr. Trump’s failings:
“One of the reasons I’m willing to come out of my shell and talk to you is because I think democracy is at stake. And maybe I’ll be able to convince some other people of that. And get them to support Democrats in 2018.”

Still, the deal highlights the tension of media outlets selling themselves to billionaires. Doing so may provide financial security, but there’s no way to prevent new owners from exerting more editorial control in the future. And if the outlets can’t make money, benefactors could sell them or shut them down.
American financial titans like the Blackstone Group’s Steve Schwarzman often lobbied presidents to go easy on China. Their hope: winning business in China, from advising on mergers to lending money and selling financial services. But Wall Street’s influence in Washington isn’t helping to ease trade tensions.

Even as they win tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks from the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress, they appear to be able to do little to stop the trade war. “What’s really surprising is that the connections that used to work, the formula that used to work, just don’t work at this point,” said Marshall W. Meyer, an emeritus professor of management at the Wharton School of Business.
Senior finance executives held talks with Chinese officials and bankers over the weekend. But with Wall Street holding less sway in Washington, the trade war (which could escalate this week; more on that below) might mean that such relationships won’t pay off.
The Tesla C.E.O. famously said that the company would have to endure “production hell” to speed up manufacturing of its Model 3 sedan. Now he says there’s a new source of fire and brimstone.
“We’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell,” Mr. Musk wrote in 
The Tesla chief said that the delivery problem was “far more tractable” than the production issues, but that the company was “making rapid progress” on solving it. Mr. Musk 
The e-commerce giant is said to be investigating a series of data leaks and employee bribes as part of a push to stamp out seller scams from its service. More on that from Jon Emont, Laura Stevens and Robert McMillan 
In exchange for payments ranging from about $80 to more than $2,000, brokers for Amazon employees in Shenzhen are offering internal sales metrics and reviewers’ email addresses, as well as a service to delete negative reviews and restore banned Amazon accounts, the people said. Amazon is investigating a number of incidents involving employees, including some in the U.S., suspected of accepting these bribes, according to people familiar with the matter.
Amazon told the WSJ that it had introduced systems that restrict and audit the kinds of data that employees can access. Sources told the newspaper that the company has also reorganized the roles of key executives in China to try to find the source of the problem.

While Kleiner has hired new high-level partners, it still has a lot to do to convince Silicon Valley that it remains a top-flight V.C. firm.
As the federal government prepares for a new fiscal year, one thing is certain: The national debt will grow. The Congressional Budget Office predicts the amount of debt held by the American public will hit $28.7 trillion — 96 percent of G.D.P. — in 10 years. 
Just holding the line at 78% of GDP over the next three decades would require finding massive, immediate savings in the budget — $400 billion over the coming year, rising gradually to $690 billion by 2048, using 2019 dollars. In comparison, America spent $590 billion in fiscal 2017 on defense, and $610 billion on all other discretionary items. (The rest of the $4 trillion in spending went for mandatory programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, and for interest on the debt.)

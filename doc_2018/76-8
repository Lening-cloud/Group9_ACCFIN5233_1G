Here’s what we’re watching:
• President Trump is meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Trade’s likely on the agenda.
• Senator Bob Corker wants to rein in the Trump tariffs.
• Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon are campaigning to end corporate America’s fixation on quarterly earnings estimates.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced on Thursday that the U.S. has struck an agreement to save the embattled telecom company. But it’s unclear whether the White House has gotten a good deal.
Here are the main details of the agreement, per 
• A $1 billion fine, and an additional $400 million penalty that will be held to cover potential future violations
• Changes to ZTE’s board and management team within 30 days
• A compliance team chosen by U.S. officials embedded in the Chinese company
“This should serve as a very good deterrent, not only for them but for other potential bad actors,” Mr. Ross said.
That remains an open question, but the three have chosen an executive to run their health care venture, Mr. Buffett told CNBC. He said an announcement will come within two weeks.
There’s still opportunity for banks to find new customers and encourage existing ones to be more active.
But that’s not quite the whole picture. The percentage of active accounts around the world has risen from 52 percent to just 53 percent over the same period. That means that even if people are opening accounts, they’re still not using them. And in some countries, the use of bank accounts is actually falling.
But the World Bank offers some approaches that could be used to encourage further adoption, and use of, accounts:
The N.F.L.’s Carolina Panthers sold for about $2.2 billion. The N.B.A.’s Houston Rockets fetched roughly that same price. With few signs that valuations will retreat anytime soon, 
Traditionally, private equity firms haven’t taken ownership of sports franchises, in large part because leagues have preferred working with individuals or small groups of people. (One notable exception is Tom Gores 
That has led to individual financiers paying out of pocket to become owners, as Josh Harris of Apollo Global Management and David Blitzer of Blackstone did with 
Valuations of sports teams have skyrocketed in recent years. Probably the biggest culprit is the ever-increasing price for media rights, particularly as digital players like Facebook and Twitter bid against traditional TV networks.
The latest example: 
As that money flows down to sports teams, their own valuations are going up. And that means, as the sports investment banker John Moag told Institutional Investor, having even $1 billion won’t be enough to afford a franchise:
“One person may be willing to put in $300 million to $500 million, but where will the remainder of the money come from? He will dial for dollars, but that’s still a huge amount of money.”
We can think of two issues that need to be addressed:
Whether sports leagues — which are governed by their individual owners — will drop their longstanding aversion to having Wall Street investment firms joining their ranks. Whether private equity firms would be willing to hold onto sports teams long enough to recoup their investments and make big profits, while avoiding the kinds of financial meddling that could destroy even championship franchises.
How do you raise a fund that’s as large as your two previous biggest combined? Reputation certainly counts for a lot.
And Mr. Trott, and his firm BDT Capital, seem to have plenty of that. Warren Buffett has described the financier as 
But can he raise a new fund of $9 billion, as 
Mr. Trott certainly has a long list of accomplishments to cite in pitches to investors. He has become one of the premiere bankers for wealthy families like the Pritzkers, the scions of the Hyatt hotel fortune, and the Reimanns, the secretive German clan behind the consumer conglomerate JAB Holding.
More from Eric Platt and Mark Vandevelde of the FT:
The so-called family offices where Mr. Trott wields clout and raises much of his capital are garnering increasing power on Wall Street, as they hire investment teams to buy midsized companies outright instead of ploughing money into funds run by outside fund managers.
Working for so-called family offices has been good business for BDT. For example, the firm has helped JAB assemble its burgeoning food-and-coffee empire, which includes Peet’s Coffee, Keurig Green Mountain, Dr Pepper Snapple and, soon, the 
Such connections have helped Mr Trott’s company to strike its own investments — in partnership with those families — as well, like when it 
Paul Achleitner, Deutsche Bank’s chairman, has spoken with top shareholders about merging with German rival Commerzbank, 
Achleitner has discussed a combination of the two lenders with investors and key German government officials in recent months, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations. While there are currently no formal discussions between the two banks and any such move is not imminent, the chairman is talking now with stakeholders about a possible deal down the road, they said. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment.
A key obstacle is Deutsche Bank’s depressed share price, with investors telling Achleitner that they don’t want a merger with Commerzbank at the moment because it would be highly dilutive and potentially trigger a capital increase and hefty write-downs, the people said.

Reports about potential new features for the image-sharing social platform highlight how its service appears to be increasingly pulled in multiple directions.
Earlier this week, citing anonymous sources, the 
The feature, which could allow videos of up to an hour in length, will focus on vertical video, or video that is taller than it is wide, one of the people said. The feature, if it launches, will do so within the Instagram app, another person said.
Instagram will offer a dedicated space featuring scripted shows, music videos and more in vertically oriented, full-screen, high-def 4K resolution. Instagram has been meeting with popular social media stars and content publishers to find out how their video channels elsewhere would work within its app.
Benedict Evans, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, points out that in layering on new features, the photo-sharing service could turn itself into two distinct products:
It’s plausible that Instagram could break itself up into two apps. One could be focused more on messaging and peer-to-peer image and video sharing. The other might emphasize discovery and a greater tie-in to e-commerce, with judicious use of artificial intelligence to provide users with focused product recommendations.
But these are similar headaches to those that prompted Snap to redesign its Snapchat app, and that has

Companies frequently hold back on technology spending, hiring, and research and development to meet quarterly earnings forecasts that may be affected by factors outside the company’s control, such as commodity-price fluctuations, stock-market volatility and even the weather.

But would that matter? Klint Finley of Wired 
Roger Entner, a founder of Recon Analytics and co-author of the CTIA report, concedes that it might not matter much if the US introduces 5G a few months later than China. Europe was quicker to roll out 2G, and Japan was the first with 3G, but that hardly deterred Apple and Google from dominating the smartphone market. But Entner argues that if China beats the US by a year or two, it could damage the US’s ability to compete in the global technology market.

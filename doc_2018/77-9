• Stocks briefly dipped into the red on hawkish Fed.
• Could General Electric be dropped from the Dow?
• The C.F.P.B. setup is constitutional.
• Boeing is powering the Dow again.
Shares of the social media giant fell more than 4 percent after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.
The reason? The cost of fixing Facebook. To address mounting criticism, Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often.
Of those changes, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said in the companies earnings release:
“Already last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people’s time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day. By focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term.”
That’s an important metric for demanding higher ad rates.
But an hour after its results hit the tape, the stock rebounded and then turned positive.
What soothed investors’ concerns? Facebook said on its call with analysts 
“The impact it has on monetization is certainly not clearly negative,” Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, told analysts.
The stock is up 1.5 percent after hours.
The social media giant 
$4.27 billion— The company’s profit for the quarter, including a $3.19 billion tax charge.
$12.97 billion — Facebook’s revenue for the quarter, up 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.
1.4 billion — The number of daily active users, up from 1.37 billion in the third quarter.
Digging deeper, there were several impressive numbers in Facebook’s earnings. Its operating profits as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin, ballooned in the fourth quarter to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in the same period last year. Its average revenue per Facebook user increased at a 28 percent clip in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016. That year-on-year growth rate is higher than the 26 percent recorded in the third quarter.
But there were numbers that investors will keep an eye on. Changes Facebook made to its news feed reduced the “time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.” Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.
Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.
The Federal Reserve, as was widely expected, left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. But the market focused on the change to the Fed’s inflation language.
“Inflation on a 12‑month basis is expected 
“Inflation on a 12‑month basis is expected 
Though the market expected the Fed to raise rates at its March meeting, that language change caused stocks to briefly turn negative. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index, which had traded as high as 2839, slipped to 2817 an hour after the Fed’s statement. It recovered in the final hour of trading to finish up at 2824.
Analysts over at Deutsche Bank think the chances are increasing. They write:
“GE continues to face substantial challenges including earnings and cash pressure, tough global power generation markets, aggressive downsizing, shrinking its portfolio, management shake-up and SEC investigations.”
The analysts add:
“As the company’s absolute share price has continued to drop (and as the share prices of the other companies have been increasing), GE increasingly falls into the category of outlier and consequently a likely candidate for removal, in our opinion.
“The committee reportedly prefers for the Dow to incur no more than a 10:1 ratio between the component companies’ highest share price and lowest share price. Currently, the ratio between Boeing (the highest) and GE (the lowest) exceeds 20:1.”
G.E. was among 12 original Dow components when the index was started in 1896 and is the only one of those companies still in the Dow. After briefly being removed twice during the Dow’s first five years, G.E. has been a member of the index for more than 110 years.
A federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s director can only be fired by the president for cause. The NYT’s Stacy Cowley reports:
When Congress created the bureau seven years ago, it specified that the director —after being nominated by the president to a five-year term and confirmed by the Senate — could only be removed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance.” That is different than the structure of most other federal agencies, whose leaders can typically be removed at will by a president.

Boeing’s rally Wednesday has accounted for about 50 percent of the Dow Jones industrial average’s 250 point gain in early trading.
Boeing’s 12 percent rally over the past year has powered the Dow’s run to record highs. Earlier this month when the Dow surpassed 26000 just eight days after topping 25000, Boeing accounted for about a third of the index’s 1,000-point gain.

President Trump also touted the trickle-down effect of the tax overhaul during Tuesday’s State of the Union address:
“Since we passed tax cuts, roughly three million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands of dollars per worker.”
The tax law indeed has prompted hundreds of employers, including at least 40 members of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, to pass on savings to workers.
Much of those perks have come in the form of one-time bonuses. Many companies have also said they would increase base wages, expand benefits and raise charitable donations.

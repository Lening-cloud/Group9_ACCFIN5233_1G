Over the past few years, DJ Khaled has grown into several new roles: 
âYDTMHTLâ stands for âYou donât tell me how to live!,â a refrain that young women can shout back at unwanted judgments or advice delivered with âfake concern.â On this first song from an album due in April, âCapture the Flag,â the 
âNothing but happiness, nothing but joy,â the Malian songwriter Sidi TourÃ© declares in this song celebrating a wedding. And sheer euphoria radiates from a groove that starts with a succinct desert-blues guitar lick, then keeps piling up polyrhythms, foreground and background, until itâs utterly, gloriously head spinning. J.P.
The British band Shopping comes from the skeletal-repetition school of post-punk, and âSuddenly Gone,â from its album âThe Official Body,â is constructed from a small handful of terse single-note guitar lines and bass riffs behind Rachel Aggs brusquely chanting a critique of capitalism: âWhen will you recognize a single consequence/or are you waiting until everythingâs gone?â The wild card, rare in this very austere genre, is a second, overdubbed drum kit; against a dutiful steady wallop, its rumbles and crashes incite some anarchy.

Two songs from the forthcoming Rae Sremmurd triple album, one from each member. But rather than propose new stand-alone identities, these songs end up reinforcing â leaning on, really â the component parts that when combined, have made Rae Sremmurd 
The pianist Keith Jarrett hasnât performed with his longtime trio in many years, but on Friday he released âAfter the Fall,â a collection of 12 jazz classics recorded in concert 20 years ago. This is a straight-ahead trio for the ages, fed by a tension between Mr. Jarrettâs resolute, lapidary touch and the collectiveâs shape-shifting, onward drive. On âBouncinâ With Bud,â the tuneful Bud Powell classic, Jack DeJohnette maintains a openhanded clatter on the drums, while Mr. Jarrett revels in the tuneâs major-key buoyancy. Stating the melody, he rounds off some of 
âRunâ follows a bad breakup, enfolded by lies and contradictions and divided loyalties among friends. âJust donât kick me when Iâm down,â sings the woman who calls herself pronoun, singing both alone and multitracked. âYouâre just another lost and found.â The track is stolid three-chord rock, building and pounding and gleaming, subsiding and building again. And the situation is a pre-emptive defense. Pronoun knows full well that, âYouâre gonna run.â J.P.
There are rappers who write words and then hope to put them to a melody, and then there is Valee, who is melody first, cadence second, imaginative and sometimes odd lyrics third (but never an afterthought). âMiamiâ is an older song of his, but now that heâs signed to G.O.O.D. Music, itâs being revived for his major-label debut EP, âGOOD Job, You Found Me.â On this remix, he even nudges Pusha T, he of the irreducible snarl, toward a stop-start flow that sounds like boasts being delivered backward. J.C.
The only album likely to be released internationally this year with lyrics in Cornish â an ancient, vanishing British language â is âLe Kovâ by the Welsh singer and songwriter Gwenno. The album is a grab-bag of styles, often retro, but âHerdhyaâ sets a whispery, Celtic-tinged vocal to eerie electronica, full of time-reversed chords and echoey piano tones. As the lyrics examine post-Brexit isolation, the music posits a very uncertain future. J.P.
A U.K. rap remix of âLook Aliveâ that takes the interaction on 
Humor faces down desolation in âNobodyâs Homeâ from âCall Me Lucky,â an existential ramble from the latest album by the sage, scratchy-voiced, blues-rooted, 73-year-old songwriter Chris Smither: âEverybody wants to text me âcause they ainât got nothing to say,â he notes. He recorded two versions, as he did with half a dozen of the albumâs songs; oneâs a ragtimey cackle, while the other is slower and more pensive, revealing a little more darkness. J.P.
Anthony Braxton has always seen his reconstituted, spatial music as a part of a wide tradition, lacing free improvisation into new compositional models. The jazz world has never known quite what to do with it all. But Mr. Braxton, an inclusive thinker and far-ranging saxophonist,

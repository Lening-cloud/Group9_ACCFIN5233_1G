â¢ How bad will the U.S.-China trade fight be?
Dropbox faces fierce competition, doesnât make a profit, its user growth has slowed, and outside shareholders have negligible voting power.
Yet for now, at least, investors think the company has an amazing future.
This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropboxâs shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday. They leaped to $29 per share from $21, giving Dropbox, which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers, a market value of $12.7 billion. Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors. Dropbox didnât have any profits in recent years, so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows.
At $29, Dropbox is trading at 11.5 times last yearâs revenue of $1.1 billion. That is far higher than the 2.6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index, according to Bloomberg data.
Of course, Dropboxâs shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies. The stock might give back the gains, just as Snapâs did after its I.P.O. last year.
Still, Dropboxâs fans believe that the company has a strong financial future, despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon. One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs, a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time. Rishi N. Jaluria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, zeros in on its free cash flows, the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments, to show this.
His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year, but, in his estimation, that margin could rise to 19 percent this year, then 22 percent in 2019.
After Fridayâs huge pop, Dropboxâs stock has arguably âpriced inâ the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect. Indeed, using Mr. Jaluriaâs forecasts, Dropboxâs shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce, a software and cloud computing company with a long track record.
What is more, Dropbox has areas of concern that should, in theory, give investors pause. The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year, slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016. Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year. Facebookâs shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropboxâs. Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year.
Dropbox finished at $28.48, up 36 percent from its initial public offering price.
The file-storage company on Thursday sold 36 million shares at $21 apiece. That was above its expected range of $18 to $20 a share and valued the company $9.2 billion.
At Fridayâs close, Dropbox is valued at $12.5 billion

The president abruptly 
Early in the day, the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill, citing Congressâs failure to fund his long-promised border wall.
From this morning:
Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D. Shear of the NYT:
But the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nationâs southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security â including new technology and repairs to existing barriers â but not Mr. Trumpâs wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.
(The backstory to the bill: Hereâs how Congressional leaders 
In most of the interviews on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress, a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives.
âIâd be happy toâ¦â he told CNNâs Laurie Segall, before immediately qualifying that answer with, âif itâs the right thing to do.â
He then went on to offer Facebookâs standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings.
The goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job. And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that.
He elaborated:
The question in Congressional testimony is, âWhat is the goal?â Thatâs not a media opportunity. At least itâs not supposed to be.
Mr. Zuckerberg was surely being coy. When Congress requests the presence of a C.E.O. embroiled in a high-profile controversy, theyâre usually not looking for information. They want a pelt to hang on the wall, and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive.
So itâs definitely a media opportunityâ¦ but for members of Congress, not the C.E.O.
If Mr. Zuckerberg wants proof of that, he can ask 
When Mr. Zuckerberg is brought in to testify, the committeeâs âgoalâ will be to ensure the American public understands why social media platforms canât be trusted to regulate themselves. Mr. Zuckerbergâs goal will be to try to avoid 
Mr. Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying. âI would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on, and it will make sense for me to do it,â he told Ms. Segall.
After this past week, he will have little leeway to refuse. Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he wonât want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most.
Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence, space travel and the direction of technology.
On Friday, Mr. Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans.

They purchased large-cap stocks, including Sinopec and China Life Insurance Co., Bloomberg reports.

Broadcomâs shareholders 
The vote comes nearly two weeks after 
The decision was a blow to Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, who had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration. That included appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States.

The context: Mr. Trump has made subtext â China is the U.S.âs main economic rival and must be treated as a strategic competitor â text. Few in the U.S. are happy with 
Peter Eavisâs take: A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of Chinaâs disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of U.S. firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent. Still, much could go wrong.

The stateâs attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is expected to announce today that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is settling an investigation over its electronic trading practices.
Mr. Schneiderman is expected to announce that the bank routed some clientsâ trade orders to so-called electronic liquidity providers like Citadel Securities, then doctored trade confirmations and post-trade reports to say it had executed them in-house. The attorney general said the process was applied to some 16 million client orders between 2008 and 2013.

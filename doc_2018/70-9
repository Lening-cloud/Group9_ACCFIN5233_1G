President Trump 
“
Last year, international leaders were stunned by Mr. Trump’s unapologetic defense of America going it alone. This year? They pushed back, defending pacts that Mr. Trump has quit, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement. President Emmanuel Macron of France proposed a moratorium on trade deals with countries that don’t accept climate rules.
The combative tone suggests that battle lines between the U.S. and the rest of the world have hardened. A return to a pre-Trump global order isn’t likely anytime soon.
Jes Staley has led Barclays for three years, helping it surmount legal troubles and find a surer financial footing. Rivals are edging away from risky investment banking, but Mr. Staley embraces it.

Tightening labor markets usually mean rising wages. That hasn’t happened in recent years. That has puzzled economists, but some think they have an explanation: 
The average U.S. worker now receives 
That growth may have persuaded the Fed to keep raising interest rates. But Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT notes that even wages including benefits are growing slowly by historical standards — and it’s not clear when that will change.
The escalating trade war hasn’t cooled investor demand for Chinese securities. Foreign ownership of Chinese stocks and bonds has grown 64 percent over the past year, according to Z-Ben Advisors.
Access to China’s markets and its economy has been a key issue in the country’s trade dispute with the U.S., and a point of tension with the E.U., too. In recent months, however, Beijing has

The amateurish appearance of USAReally has led some critics to assume that it is either a bizarre vanity project or a decoy meant to attract attention away from more covert Russian campaigns happening elsewhere. But some cybersecurity experts believe the website may be a part of a retooled Russian propaganda operation that is experimenting with new tactics ahead of November’s midterm elections, and testing the boundaries of what American social media companies will allow.

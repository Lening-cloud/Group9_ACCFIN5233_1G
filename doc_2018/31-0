As the U.S. fights a trade battle with China over technology by imposing tariffs on everything from medical devices to metals, it turns out that American officials reached for similar tactics over a wholly different issue. The NYT reports that the Trump administration 
Ecuador’s government, and others supportive of breast-feeding, backed down from proposing the resolution — which then passed after Russia introduced it. The standoff was the latest instance of the Trump administration siding with corporate interests: the formula feeding industry, in this case.

In some cities, cameras scan train stations for China’s most wanted. Billboard-size displays show the faces of jaywalkers and list the names of people who can’t pay their debts. Facial recognition scanners guard the entrances to housing complexes.
The government also tracks the likes of internet use, hotel stays and travel. While Mr. Mozur points out that Beijing’s ambitions currently outstrip its abilities — not all cities are using this kind of technology — a long and growing list of convictions suggest that China’s high-tech authoritarian future is well on course.
The trans-Atlantic venture capital firm, with offices in London and San Francisco, has enjoyed a run this year that included the multibillion-dollar I.P.O.s of Dropbox and the financial processor Adyen, and the $2.2 billion sale of iZettle to PayPal.

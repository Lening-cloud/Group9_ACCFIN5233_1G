President Trump said yesterday that the Chinese government was sending âvery strong signalsâ about what might emerge from the trade truce he and President Xi Jinping reached last weekend in Buenos Aires. The comment was apparently a reference to remarks of Beijing being âconfidentâ a comprehensive deal can be reached before a tariff freeze expires in 90 days.
Plenty of people are unconvinced. More from 
â¢ âMr. Trump and his advisers have been touting the trade truce reached in Buenos Aires as a victory, saying that China had agreed to buy $1.2 trillion worth of American products.â
â¢ âBut trade experts and industry insiders remain perplexed, anxiously awaiting information about the timing and composition of the $1.2 trillion, a number that dwarfs the $130 billion in goods that the United States exported to China last year.â
â¢ âIf China doubled the amount of goods it bought from the United States starting next year, it would take nearly a decade to reach the $1.2 trillion goal.â

Thereâs a huge business opportunity in climate change. Exploiting it is the hard part.
In a climate change report published yesterday, scientists likened the quickening growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions to a â
âWorries donât translate into solutions unless businesses devise products that emit dramatically less planet-warming greenhouse gases. The innovation is the easy part; getting people to buy it is the hard part. That requires incentives, which depend heavily on governments. Without their intervention, solar and wind power, and electric and hybrid cars would have no foothold against their fossil fuel competitors.â
But he also notes that many government interventions arenât sufficiently informed by long-term thinking. Tom Linebarger, the chief executive of the engine maker Cummins, tells Mr. Ip that thereâs an obvious path forward. âIf we want rules that are more effective, decide the end result we want and let technology compete for the best solution,â he said. âCarbon taxes are much better than all the other choices.â
The U.S. markets were closed yesterday in honor of former President George Bush. When they reopen today, there could be bad news.
A new study by UBS suggests worldwide unemployment was 5.2 percent in September. Thatâs down from 8 percent in 2010, and the lowest level since 1980.
More on the numbers 
Arend Kapteyn, UBS chief economist, said that greater labor market flexibility since the financial crisis â due to factors such as lower wages and the advent of the gig economy â had helped lower the natural rate of unemployment in many countries.
The change has been particularly pronounced in Eastern Europe: Polish unemployment has fallen to 6.2 percent from 20 percent in 2002, for instance, and Croatia and Slovakia have similar stories. But unemployment has dropped in many of the largest economies too, including the U.S., Britain, Germany and Japan.

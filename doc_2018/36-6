The good times that returned to Wall Street after President Donald Trump got elected are now flowing into the pockets of the big banksâ C.E.Os:

Letâs take Mr. Corbat.
Citigroupâs stock rose 25 percent in 2017, a lot more than the 16 percent posted by the KBW Bank Index. Investors piled into bank stocks because of expectations of stronger economic growth, and also because they expected the Trump administration to loosen banking regulations.
Citiâs underlying businesses improved last year. The bank also got through the Federal Reserveâs stress tests in 2017 without objections from the regulator, something it had struggled to do in previous years.
The message from Citiâs board seems to be that, since the bankâs performance is now much closer to that of its peers, Mr. Corbatâs pay also needs to be in the vicinity of his counterparts on Wall Street.
Citi may be doing better than in the past, but its return on equity, a metric that shows a bankâs return on its capital, was only 6.6 percent last year. Bank of Americaâs was 6.7 percent. Both are well below the 10 percent earned at JPMorgan.
C.E.O.sâ compensation is made up of different types of pay:
â¢ Cash salaries and cash bonuses
â¢ Stock-based bonuses that are paid out over the coming years, and whose value is, to differing degrees, dependent on how the company performs in the future.
The theory: The more performance-related pay, the more accountable the executive is.
Investors should keep an eye on the amount of performance share units (P.S.U.s) that are included in a comp package, since these are usually the type of stock award that are most at risk of a decline in value if a bank underperforms by certain yardsticks.
â¢ Mr. Dimonâs pay appears most dependent on P.S.U.s. They made up 
â¢ By contrast, Mr. Moynihan had 
Bank of America and Citi would likely assert that the rest of their stock-based awards are also somewhat dependent on the performance of the bank. But shareholders might be happier if all the stock bonus were in P.S.U.s.

â¢ Raising the breakup fee for antitrust reasons beyond $8 billion. That amount, which represents an already high 6.6 percent of the total deal price, still isnât high enough for Qualcomm. âA breakup fee in the range proposed by Broadcom does not come close to compensating for those risks,â Paul Jacobs, Qualcommâs chairman, writes in a letter to Broadcomâs chief, Hock Tan.
â¢ Make unspecified other commitments meant to assuage antitrust regulators.
â¢ Clarify what Broadcomâs intentions are for Qualcommâs big licensing business.
More from Mr. Jacobsâs letter:
Our board is open to further discussions with Broadcom to see if a proposal that appropriately reflects the true value of Qualcomm shares, and ensures an appropriate level of deal certainty, can be obtained.
If the two sides canât reach an agreement, then matters may come down to a vote on Qualcommâs board on March 6. Remember that Broadcom is seeking six of 11 board seats, down from its initial target of unseating all directors.
Britainâs government is often criticized for not clearly communicating the type of deal it wants to strike with the European Union as it prepares to leave the bloc.
But, 
Post-Brexit, Britainâs banks and financial firms would lose special rights that allow them to operate in any E.U. country with few restrictions. Britain could fall back on an arrangement that would allow British banks to do business in the E.U. if they operated under regulations that were equivalent to those in the bloc. But this arrangement has drawbacks. It does not cover important types of financial activities, and British banks may have to comply with any changes to regulation that the E.U. introduces.
The scheme that Britain may now propose appears designed to address those problems. It would allow both sides leeway to strike their own rules once theyâve agreed on their main objectives. And it suggests that a monitoring regime and mechanism for resolving disputes be set up.
The bloc may reject such a proposal because it would risk losing some control over financial regulation. Certain politicians in the E.U. may argue Britain is trying to retain the privileges of the single market while discarding the duties that come with it. Still, some of Europeâs leaders, banks and businesses may support the plan, in the belief that it will minimize disruption and allow the City of London to continue to play a big role in financing the strong economic expansion taking place in Europe.
Peter Thiel.
Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Thiel Macro, which invests Mr. Thielâs fortune, held put options on 1.9 million shares of ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures as of Dec. 31. The investment is designed to pay off if the VIX rises.
Itâs unclear whether the fund had maintained those positions through last week. But if it had, he would have reaped a big windfall.
Investors piled into bets that volatility would continue to decline last year. And those wagers paid off as the VIX spent 2017 trading at historically low levels. But volatility has picked up this year. After trading below 10 to start the year, the VIX spiked to above 37 during the selloff last week. It finished Friday at 19.

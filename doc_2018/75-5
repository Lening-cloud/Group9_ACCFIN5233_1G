When Andy Rubin, the creator of Android, left Google in 2014, he was given a $90 million exit package and an investment in his next venture. Left unsaid was that he had been accused of sexual misconduct by a fellow employee with whom heâd had an affair.
That was one of several instances where

Not everyone at Google feels reassured, according to Daisuke Wakabayashi and Katie Benner of the NYT:
âWhen Google covers up harassment and passes the trash, it contributes to an environment where people donât feel safe reporting misconduct,â said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer for more than a decade and an activist on workplace issues. âThey suspect that nothing will happen or, worse, that the men will be paid and the women will be pushed aside.â

The S.&P. 500 rose by 1.9 percent yesterday, bringing it back into positive territory for 2018. (The index was up 1.2 percent for the year by the closing bell.) Strong earnings from companies like Twitter and Microsoft seemed to ease some worries of investors, who have been focused on issues like the trade war with China, rising interest rates and the midterms.
Today could be different. Amazon and Googleâs parent company, Alphabet, 
But all this whipsawing may not portend gloom, according to 
The stock market tumble of the last few weeks is not a mystery to be solved, nor a warning of horrible things to come, so much as an inevitable result of the economic expansion reaching a more mature stage. The stock market looks forward, not back â share prices are determined by what investors think the future looks like. And the economic future is starting to look quite different from the past.

Some key points from the WSJâs Shalini Ramachandran and Joe Flint:
â¢ âEmployees are encouraged to give one another blunt feedback. Managers are all told to apply a âkeeper testâ to their staff â asking themselves whether they would fight to keep a given employee â a mantra for firing people who donât fit the culture and ensuring only the strongest survive.â
â¢ âThe firings can be insensitive, several former employees said. Ernie Tam, who had worked as a Netflix engineer for six years, was called into his managerâs office on a Monday morning in 2015. âYouâre no longer a star performer,â the manager said. An HR representative came in, discussed Mr. Tamâs severance package and took his laptop.â
â¢ âOnce people are fired, Netflix believes in explaining the reasons. The emails about firings can reach hundreds of employees across multiple divisions and can be painfully specific, calling out an employeeâs flaws, while inviting more questions and gossip, many employees say.â
Two years ago, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia unveiled a plan to wean his country from oil and diversify its economy. But the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi 
Prominent Western business executives like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Larry Fink of BlackRock abandoned this weekâs big Saudi investment conference, and the crowd was mostly made up of lower-profile Russian, Asian and Arab attendees. And the scandal may reduce Prince Mohammedâs ability to work with international investors while finding new places to invest his countryâs wealth abroad.
Not everyone has abandoned the Saudis â 
As Denis Florin of the consultancy Lavoisier Conseil told the NYT, âPractically, is this going to delay M.B.S.âs ambitions? Yes. Is it going to wreck them? No.â
The renminbi fell by as much as 0.22 percent this morning. That puts it within spitting distance of its lowest level against the dollar since the global financial crisis in 2008, 
The slide is the latest problem for Chinaâs weakening economy. Last week Beijing reported that the economy was experiencing its slowest growth since 2009, and it has introduced stimulus initiatives to turn things around. So far, none have worked well. Pan Gongsheng, the deputy governor of the Peopleâs Bank of China, said that the central bank would continue to take measures to ensure the currency remains stable, 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be watching closely. He has commented on the falling value of the renminbi and warned China not to adjust the currency improperly. Though he has stopped short of labeling the country a currency manipulator, he has warned that the renminbiâs value would be a crucial aspect of trade talks.
Among Donald Trumpâs most crucial backers during his presidential campaign was a longtime friend, the investor Tom Barrack. A billionaire deal maker who made his name with transactions for the Plaza hotel and Miramax, Mr. Barrack thought Mr. Trump could make it to the White House â and get him a plum government role.
But Caleb Melby of Bloomberg Businessweek shows that the wager 
He damaged relations with the Qatari royal family, his best business partner in the Middle East, by helping orchestrate a relationship between the White House and the Saudis. Meanwhile, Colony hemorrhaged talent, raised only half the debt fundâs target, and entered into an ill-fated merger. Its shares have fallen about 60 percent since Trumpâs inauguration, even as U.S. market indexes have risen more than 20 percent.

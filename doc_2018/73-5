President Trump escalated his trade war with Beijing yesterday by 
A refresher on why this is happening: The tariffs aim to pressure China into changing longstanding trade practices that Mr. Trump says hurt the U.S. The administration says China could win relief by giving U.S. companies more access to its markets, among other things.

Broadly, however, markets shrugged off the latest tariffs. Why? 
What is clear is that U.S. consumers will start to bear the cost of American protectionism.
The Justice Department has 
In approving the deal, the Justice Department decided that combining an insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager wouldnât reduce competition. It appears to be another sign that vertical mergers, where two companies in different industries combine, are acceptable to the Trump administration. (Its effort to block AT&T from buying Time Warner increasingly looks like a political anomaly.)
The move augurs well for CVSâs bid to acquire the insurer Aetna â and for many more potential tie-ups. With Amazon looming over the sector, other companies may be tempted to take the merger plunge.

Coke would be a different player. The company is openly pushing into new markets to offset slowing soda sales. (See: its $5.1 billion deal for Costa.) The company says itâs watching the growth in cannabis-infused drinks for now, but itâs not hard to imagine buzz-inducing Coke products hitting store shelves.
The company is a dominant force in e-commerce, and its cloud-computing division is a juggernaut. That success is why the company should split itself in two, 
In a note to clients, the analyst, Mark May, said that breaking up the company could yield two successful businesses: a retail company with an enterprise value of $400 billion and a cloud-computing business worth $600 billion. It would also help Amazon avoid antitrust scrutiny at a time when President Trump appears to be focused on the company.
So far, investors appear uneasy with the idea. Amazon shares fell 3 percent after the report was published.

The sting isnât necessarily that Lucid secured funding from the Saudis when Elon Musk couldnât (though that has to hurt a little). Itâs that Tesla, already grappling with competition from traditional carmakers like General Motors and Daimler, must now contend with a well-funded upstart that wants to grab the luxury end of market.
Tesla investors can only hope that Mr. Musk, who has seemed distracted lately, can focus on beating the competition.
Yusaku Maezawa, the founder of the online Japanese clothing company Zozo, will be the 
The timing of the trip is uncertain: Elon Musk, SpaceXâs C.E.O., said that the so-called B.F.R. spacecraft would not be ready until 2023 at the earliest.
Neither Mr. Musk nor Mr. Maezawa would talk about the cost. But Mr. Musk did say that developing the rocket would cost $2 billion to $10 billion, and that Mr. Maezawaâs ticket was a significant investment in the project.
Jana Bakunina runs the venture capital firm Silvergate Investment, which invests only in companies founded by women or by men from minority backgrounds. 
First: âSo you are a charity?â This view suggests that women need help from altruistic donors to get their businesses going. Second: âAh! You are a social impact fund!â This response insinuates that women cannot possibly make you rich, so there needs to be a social mission attached to give an investor something virtuous to talk about at dinner parties. Third: âGreat, but why would you limit yourself?â This may seem like a fair comment, but if you asked me about my deal flow I would tell you that I reviewed more than 100 opportunities in six months and was blown away by the quality of applications.
In fact, she writes, she wants to make money, and the firmâs approach allows her to identify opportunities that âare largely overlooked â and therefore attractive.â
What do you think about Silvergateâs approach?

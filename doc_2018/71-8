The conglomerate has agreed to combine its transportation business to Wabtec in a tax-free transaction, valued at about $11.1 billion.
The deal is the first move to shed an entire business since John Flannery became C.E.O. in August, and it likely presages more. Mr. Flannery said last fall that he wanted to sell off $20 billion in assets.
Since the end of the financial crisis, G.E. has sold roughly $200 billion of assets. The company has moved to exit its finance arm, sold NBCUniversal and divested its appliance business that most people associated with G.E.
Here’s a timeline of some of G.E.’s biggest transactions since the financial crisis.
Paul Singer’s hedge fund lost when it took on Samsung three years ago. But the activist investor has claimed victory in its latest battle with a South Korean conglomerate, or chaebol.
“Hyundai Mobis will withdraw the proposal in its current form in order to have an opportunity to supplement and improve the restructuring plan, including the proposed spinoff merger,” Lim Young-deuk, the C.E.O. of a Hyundai affiliate at the center of the fight, wrote in 
Here’s how the hedge fund prevailed.
Elliott took aim at Hyundai Motor because it was one of the last chaebols that needed to revamp its corporate structure and 
Elliott said that the restructuring plan showed management “has failed to act in the best interest of the companies and their respective shareholders.” It instead proposed turning Hyundai Motor into a holding company that it said was more tax efficient and sustainable.
The hedge fund had 
In a presentation earlier this year, the hedge fund noted that Hyundai’s proposed transaction was similar to what Samsung wanted to do in 2015, where the company sold an affiliate to the chaebol’s holding company. There, Samsung was able to rally individual investors, who accounted for nearly a third of its shareholder base, to its cause.
By contrast, retail investors comprise some 5 percent of Hyundai’s shareholder base. Big international institutions, which make up the bulk of Hyundai’s investors, are likely to be more immune to the entreaties of companies under attack from an activist if the campaign makes sense financially.
Stock markets are up so far this month, suggesting in part that investors were betting that tensions between the United States and its largest trading partners would ease.
That seemed to occur this weekend. The United States and China issued a joint statement on trade and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said planned tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods were on hold. China did not seem to commit to much that is concrete to gain a reprieve from the tariffs, a notable achievement for the country’s negotiators.
The joint statement said China would significantly increase its imports from the United States, but it did not say how much more it would buy and over what time period. The parts of the statement about investing in each other’s country and protecting intellectual property were even vaguer.
President Trump on Monday nevertheless promoted the statement as a win. But influential members of his administration who are still spoiling for a big trade fight will no doubt want to keep up the pressure on China — and Mr. Trump may at times share their desire in the coming months. Still, the events of recent weeks show that the United States was largely isolated in its trade fights and the Trump administration may have lacked the resolve or unity to keep up its hard-edged approach. The Trump administration can, of course,reintroduce the threat of tariffs if it believes China is failing to make concessions in the proceeding trade talks. But after stepping back this weekend, it will be harder for the Trump administration to make an aggressive stance appear credible.
Indeed, the big question hanging over the Trump administration: Why did it withdraw its tariff threat now, before exacting hard, quantifiable concessions from China? One reason may be that the United States needs China’s help in dealing with North Korea ahead of Mr. Trump’s summit with Kim Jong Un planned for June. Another reason may be that China was up for a long fight with the United States and signaled so. Whatever the cause, the takeaway for investors is that the Trump administration passed up an opportunity to show China that it meant what it said.
Still, investors may not want to relax too much. Mr. Trump’s popularity has been rising even as he made combative moves on the trade front that at times roiled the market. In other words, there does not appear to be much political risk domestically, if any, to taking on China, and so Mr. Trump may use belligerent trade talk to stir up his base ahead of the midterm elections in November.
But as long as he steps back from taking tough actions, investors will most likely take his rhetoric in stride. That stance has served them well. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index is now up from where it was in mid-February when the Trump administration outlined its case for steel and aluminum tariffs.
Analysts over at Goldman Sachs are out with a report on Monday looking at the holdings of 848 hedge funds with a combined $2.3 trillion in stock market bets.

• Hedge funds added bets on Facebook more than any other stock during the first quarter, followed by Microsoft, Aetna and Monsanto.
• Amazon had the biggest reduction in wagers on it, followed by Apple, McDonald’s and Citigroup.
•Tech remained the biggest holding among hedge funds but their holdings overall decreased during the first quarter.
• Hedge funds boosted their bets on the energy sector.
• They remain the most bullish on shares of consumer discretionary companies.
• The hedge funds cut their exposure to financial stocks.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that employers will be able to include rules in contracts that force employees into individual arbitration, even if they wanted to band together to take legal action as a group, over issues about wages and hours. More details 
The vote was 5 to 4, with the court’s more conservative justices in the majority. The court’s decision on the matter could affect some 25 million employment contracts.

She tweeted:
Steven Mnuchin said this weekend, “We’re putting the trade war on hold.” S.&P. 500 futures were up on the news. But the pressure is on the Trump administration to back up its tough talk on China — a task that may be more difficult without the leverage of potential tariffs.
The fight inside the White House is still real. Free-trade supporters like Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, are still slinging arrows at hard-liners like the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro. (While Mr. Mnuchin said the tariffs were “on hold,” Mr. Lighthizer said they were still possible.)

The two sides have agreed on a “framework” under which China would increase its purchases of American goods, while putting in place “structural” changes to protect American technology and to make it easier for American companies to compete in China.
But China didn’t guarantee increasing purchases of American products by a specific amount, let alone the $200 billion reported last week. And 
G.E. was advised by Morgan Stanley and Dyal Company, the boutique investment bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs deal maker Gordon Dyal, as well as the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. Wabtec was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Jones Day.
The chief executive of G.E., John Flannery, has pledged to reduce the company’s byzantine structure and focus on its fastest-growing core businesses. Making train engines isn’t part of that equation.

Former government cyberspies, soldiers and counterintelligence officials now dominate the top ranks of banks’ security teams. They’ve brought to their new jobs the tools and techniques used for national defense: combat exercises, intelligence hubs modeled on those used in counterterrorism work and threat analysts who monitor the internet’s shadowy corners.

Today, a grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment presented by the special counselâs office. The indictment charges 12 Russian military officers by name for conspiring to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. The defendants worked for two units of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian general staff, known as the G.R.U. The defendants used two techniques to steal information. First, they used a scheme known as spear phishing, which involves sending misleading email messages and tricking the users into disclosing their passwords and security information. Second, the defendants hacked into computer networks and installed malicious software that allowed them to spy on users and capture keystrokes, take screenshots and exfiltrate, or remove, data from those computers. The defendants accessed email accounts of volunteers and employees of a U.S. presidential campaign, including the campaign chairman, starting in March of 2016. They also hacked into the computer networks of a congressional campaign committee and a national political committee. I briefed President Trump about these allegations earlier this week. The president is fully aware of the departmentâs actions today. There is no allegation in this indictment that any American citizen committed a crime. Thereâs no allegation that the conspiracy changed the vote count or affected any election result. The special counselâs investigation is ongoing and there will be no comments on the special counsel at this time.

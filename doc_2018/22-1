In the strongest sign yet that her plan to withdraw Britain from the E.U. will fail a crucial vote in Parliament next week, lawmakers 
They voted to give Parliament more control over the Brexit process should her plan be rejected. This could allow them to avoid a disorderly and economically damaging “no-deal” Brexit.
Lawmakers also voted that the government was in contempt of Parliament for failing to publish its full legal advice on Brexit — a text explaining the legal implications of the deal. That document will now be published, the government said.
A crushing defeat in the vote on Dec. 11 could force Mrs. May to abandon her deal, break up her government or even leave office. Above, anti-Brexit demonstrators outside Parliament in London.

One of the wealthiest men in the world, du Pont was also among the most prominent “wets” — as opponents of Prohibition were called. He helped lead a powerful lobby group with a not-so-hidden agenda: bring back booze, and make income taxes unnecessary with renewed levies on legal alcohol.

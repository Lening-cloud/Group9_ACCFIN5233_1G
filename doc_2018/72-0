Judging by the numbers, Hollywood should be feeling buoyant right now: The summer movie season was strong, and theaters had their busiest fall on record. October ticket sales were up 45 percent compared with last year, according to Comscore.
But 
Euphoria is almost nonexistent in studio hallways. The movie capital is instead mired in a profound malaise. The reason involves fallout from the #MeToo earthquake, both the positive changes it forced, and, lately, the pushback it has incurred. Contributing are the mega-mergers that have left Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox with new owners and may find Sony Pictures, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer sold or reconfigured before long. The steady march of Big Tech into entertainment also plays a role.

Economic growth is slowing, and the country’s hundreds of millions of middle-class shoppers seem to be holding on more tightly to their pocketbooks. Tech companies are antsy about the government’s more interventionist attitude toward big business. The tariff fight with the United States is casting a pall not simply over trade, but over China’s future writ large. This month, Alibaba cut its sales forecast for the year ending in March by around 5 percent, citing the wobbly economy and the trade war.

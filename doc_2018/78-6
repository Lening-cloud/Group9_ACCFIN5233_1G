Preysler, who was born in the Philippines but has lived in Spain since she was 16, built the home with her third husband, Spainâs former Minister of Economy and Finance Miguel Boyer, who died in 2014. Paparazzi often loiter around its gates; Preysler, 67, has been an object of fascination for Spanish-language tabloids ever since she married her first husband, the pop star Julio Iglesias, in 1971. (Her second husband was a Spanish marquis.) And it was something of a scandal that Vargas Llosa now had a desk with tidy piles of books and a bust of HonorÃ© de Balzac in a little corner of her library amid Boyerâs old science and math books. He used to live in a floor-through apartment in the heart of historic Madrid, steps away from the Royal Theater, where the streets are as narrow as trenches. But in 2015, he left his wife of 50 years for Preysler. As I followed him out onto the terrace, I wondered briefly if part of Preyslerâs appeal had been her ability to wrap him in such luxury.
We took seats under a white awning on a pair of white couches facing an aquamarine pool. My coffee arrived in a delicate pink china cup. As we talked, the sun slid behind a narrow forest of closely planted trees, which hid the street, the high stone walls and the long gravel driveway, giving the garden the illusion of a park. We talked for more than two hours in Spanish, about the Mississippi modernist William Faulkner and the Spanish superagent Carmen Balcells, about the TV shows âThe Wireâ and âVikings.â For most of our conversation, Vargas Llosa was strikingly self-contained. He barely touched his glass of water and rarely moved his hands, though he said almost everything with a smile and ended many sentences with a laugh. He was like the home itself: a fortress camouflaged in the warmth of social grace. âHe can strike one as being a very formal person, and he has cultivated that to some degree,â said Marie Arana, a Peruvian-American writer and former editor of The Washington Postâs books section. âPeople who are enormously attractive compensate by trying to be formal, to look serious.â
In March, Vargas Llosa will turn 82. He once looked like a dark-eyed John Travolta: full lips, strong chin, thick black hair. The hair is now white, but the serene manners and the prodigious self-discipline remain. He has written almost every morning of his life, publishing 59 books in 55 years, among them some of the greatest novels of the past half century: âThe Time of the Hero,â âConversation in the Cathedral,â âAunt Julia and the Scriptwriter,â âThe Feast of the Goat.â âIf I didnât write,â he told The Paris Review in 1990, âI would blow my brains out, without a shadow of a doubt.â This week Vargas Llosa has three books coming out â English translations of a novel (âThe Neighborhoodâ) and of a collection of political essays (âSabers and Utopiasâ), as well as a new volume in Spain, âThe Call of the Tribe,â which is not yet available in English. Itâs a condensed history of three centuries of classical liberal thought, from Adam Smith to Jean-FranÃ§ois Revel, that doubles as a kind of intellectual autobiography.
For Vargas Llosa, writing has always been a weapon against both despair and despotism, and âThe Call of the Tribeâ feels like his attempt to beat back the waves of nationalism and populism now flooding our world. He is a defender of individual liberty and democracy in Latin America. His attacks on authoritarians have made him enemies among both socialists and conservatives. What he most respects in a person, he told me, is integrity: âConsistency in what you believe, what you say and what you do.â And while his insistence on saying and doing exactly what he himself believes has left a scorched path in his personal life, it has also been the making of his career.
âWhen I went to live with my father, and I was feeling alone, feeling completely isolated, separated from the people whom I felt were my family, reading saved me,â Vargas Llosa told me. He buried himself in novels by Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Charles Dickens and HonorÃ© de Balzac, dreaming of a life filled with adventure. âIt was a marvelous way of not living the horrible life that I had.â
âWhen [my father] beat me,â Vargas Llosa writes in his 1993 memoir, âA Fish in the Water,â âI went off the deep end, and terror many times made me humble myself before him and beg his pardon with my hands joined. But that didnât calm him down. And he went on hitting me, screaming and threatening to put me in the army as a private as soon as I was old enough to be a recruit so that Iâd be set on the right path. When the whole scene was over and done with, and he could lock me in my room, it was not the blows, but rage and disgust with myself for having been so afraid of him and having humbled myself before him in that way, that made me spend a sleepless night, weeping in silence.â
Fiction and poetry were Marioâs refuge from Ernestoâs domestic despotism. They were also his defiance. âMy father saw literature as something extremely dangerous,â Vargas Llosa said in the garden, brushing aside his old traumas with a laugh. âHe thought that literature was a passport to failure in life, that it was a way of starving to death.â Novels, Ernesto also believed, were the work of drunk bohemians and homosexuals. Bent on turning Mario into a real man, Ernesto enrolled his son in Leoncio Prado Military Academy when he was 14. âI went to Leoncio Prado because my father thought that the military was the best cure for literature and for those activities that he understood as very marginalized.â Vargas Llosa chuckled at the paradox. âOn the contrary, he gave me the subject of my first novel!â
Even now, âThe Time of the Heroâ (1963) still has the power to shock with its scenes of bullying and dissipation among cadets. Highlights include: the gang rape of a chicken, blow jobs endured for liquor, officersâ kicking students and the killing of a boy nicknamed âSlave,â who marks himself for special humiliation when he makes the mistake of pleading for mercy with clasped hands. Incensed by the exposÃ©, administrators at Leoncio Prado Military Academy rounded up 1,000 copies and set the books aflame in an official ceremony. But a judge for Spainâs prestigious Premio Biblioteca Breve Prize declared it âthe best novel in the Spanish language in the past 30 years.â âThe Time of the Heroâ was among the first sensations of a transformative age of Latin American literature known as the Boom. (All its other major writers â Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez, Julio CortÃ¡zar, Carlos Fuentes, JosÃ© Donoso, Juan Rulfo, Miguel Ãngel Asturias and Guillermo Cabrera Infante â have died.)
Vargas Llosaâs masterwork is âConversation in the Cathedralâ (1969). Itâs Faulkner cross-pollinated with Balzac, modernist techniques used to paint a sweeping historical panorama. The structure of the novel spirals out from a single point: an unexpected meeting in 1960s Lima between Santiago Zavala, a 30-year-old reporter estranged from his upper-crust family, and Ambrosio, his familyâs former chauffeur. The two run into each other at a pound, where Ambrosio slaughters dogs for money. Together, the men get drunk at a dive bar called the Cathedral, and from their conversation rises a blistering vision of the whole of Peru under Gen. Manuel OdrÃ­aâs eight-year military dictatorship in the 1950s. Vargas Llosa implicates everyone in the moral catastrophe, from the bickering student dissidents to the cowardly media to the rich women drowning themselves in alcohol and gossip.
It is outrageous that âConversation in the Cathedralâ has never gotten the traction it deserves in the United States, and the novelâs English translation bears some of the blame. Gregory Rabassa â whose stunning translation of Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquezâs âOne Hundred Years of Solitudeâ helped make that novel an American best seller â stumbles over Vargas Llosaâs more complex style, which shifts continually between the sinuous and the slangy. âConversation in the Cathedralâ will never be an easy read in any language â itâs a book for fans of Faulkner, Proust and BolaÃ±o â but Rabassaâs errors dull its noir patina and obscure its thrilling tonal rapids. The Peruvian-American novelist Daniel AlarcÃ³n told me he shoved aside Rabassaâs version when he saw 
Why has GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquezâs magical realism cemented its place on American bookshelves and syllabuses while Vargas Llosaâs gritty masterpieces are neglected? Vargas Llosaâs best books are harder to read than GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquezâs. Heâs less sentimental, dirtier, raunchier, angrier. âOne Hundred Years of Solitudeâ looks like a Hallmark card next to âConversation in the Cathedral.â You might be fired for assigning Vargas Llosa in high school English. And Vargas Llosa has published so many novels â 18 in all â that the tours de force can get lost among the mediocrities. His buttoned-up public demeanor hasnât helped. âGaboâ was not only a tremendous writer; he was an expert showman who once worked in advertising and cannily played up his Caribbean exoticism for foreign audiences. When the two fell out in the 1970s, many intellectuals leaned left toward GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez, while Vargas Llosa was shunned.
Yet Vargas Llosa is the more daring, more democratic writer. While GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez cozied up to Fidel Castro and refined a distinctive style, Vargas Llosa reinvented his over and over again while defending free markets and reproductive freedom, gay rights and open elections. His political tracts underscore the value of diversity, of stellar public education, of equal opportunities for the poor. And his novels, whether they are kaleidoscopic histories, political thrillers, generational sagas or slapstick comedies, are remarkable for their ability to inhabit a host of perspectives. Heâs especially good at the psychology of collaborators â the people who surround authoritarians and make their administrations function. Such characters were not popular among readers in the 1960s, â70s and â80s, who preferred GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquezâs romantic heroes, but they might feel especially relevant to Americans today.
The sacrifice was provoked by the debut of another book in Spanish. This volume, âConversaciÃ³n en Princeton,â provides a view into a seminar that Vargas Llosa gave in 2015 with RubÃ©n Gallo, a professor of language and literature at Princeton University. For months, Vargas Llosa, Gallo and his students discussed five of Vargas Llosaâs most famous books, including âConversation in the Cathedral.â The whole project, Gallo explained, was inspired by his desire to do a careful, point-by-point questioning of âthe Goethe of our own timeâ in a utopian space âfree of any political pressure, and of any other pressures, save the pleasure of reading itself.â
Politics, however, were inescapable that week in Madrid. The leaders of Catalonia, the semiautonomous region that is home to Barcelona, were threatening to hold a referendum on the question of whether Catalans ought to secede from Spain. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had already declared such a referendum illegal, and Spainâs Constitutional Court had also ruled it unconstitutional. But Cataloniaâs regional president, Carles Puigdemont, looked determined to proceed.
âHow do you see whatâs happening in Catalonia?â asked the first reporter during the eventâs question-and-answer session. âI think we should focus on the book,â Vargas Llosa responded affably. Then he segued into a four-minute answer in which he recalled that Catalan nationalists were regarded as âlittle old reactionariesâ during the 1970s; opined that the current referendum was âan absurd blunder, an anachronism that has nothing to do with the realities of our timeâ; and suggested that Catalan nationalism was a kind of âillness.â âMy hope,â he said, âis that the government will have the energy necessary to impede a coup â that is really whatâs gestating â from taking place and to give it the appropriate sanctions.â Within hours, these pronouncements had made headline news in Spain, Venezuela and Peru.
Itâs almost impossible to imagine the same reaction happening here if, say, Toni Morrison or Philip Roth voiced a political opinion. But Vargas Llosa looms as a political figure in his own right: He almost became the president of Peru in 1990, and he is still admired and loathed as one of Latin Americaâs most influential champions of limited government, free enterprise, democracy and rule of law. For the past 25 years, he has penned an op-ed column called âTouchstoneâ for the Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s that is devoured by politicos in Spain and Peru. When Casa de America held an event to celebrate Vargas Llosaâs 80th birthday in 2016, attendees included the president of Chile (SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era), a former president of Uruguay (Luis Alberto Lacalle), two former presidents of Colombia (Ãlvaro Uribe and AndrÃ©s Pastrana) and two former prime ministers of Spain (JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar and Felipe GonzÃ¡lez). The event was kicked off with a speech from Prime Minister Rajoy.
âWords are acts,â Vargas Llosa said while we sat on Preyslerâs terrace, emphasizing each word as if pointing at the sentence hovering in the air. This phrase by Jean-Paul Sartre, he told me, crystallized his understanding of the novelistâs political role in the 1950s. Back then, he was a Marxist. The scenes of Communist resistance in âConversation in the Cathedralâ were inspired by his own activities at the University of San Marcos in 1953.
âImagine the â50s, when I was very young and began to write,â he said. âA young Peruvian, Chilean, Colombian lived in a country where literature meant very little. It was the activity of a tiny elite, right? So if one had a certain social conscience of the problem in countries where there were enormous inequalities, well, many times that young man with a literary vocation would ask himself, what is the point of writing if I am Peruvian, if I am Chilean, if I am Colombian? Well, there Sartre was incredibly important, because Sartre had some ideas about literature that fit perfectly with a 
In 1959, Vargas Llosa enthusiastically supported Fidel Castroâs socialist revolution in Cuba. At one point, he even housed Che Guevaraâs mother in his apartment. But as Castroâs regime developed, Vargas Llosa grew uneasy. During a trip to Havana, he learned that gay Cubans were being imprisoned with counterrevolutionaries and common criminals in forced-labor camps. âSome of them had that totally idealistic idea that the revolution was not only going to bring socialism, but it was also going to change customs, that there would be a homosexual liberation,â he said. He told me he sent a private letter to Castro, expressing his confusion and surprise.
By 1971, however, such private protest felt insufficient. When the poet Heberto Padilla was subjected to a Stalinist show trial, Vargas Llosa gathered several friends at his home in Barcelona to draft a public denunciation of Castro. This famous âPadilla letterâ appeared in the French newspaper Le Monde and was reprinted all over Latin America, signed by Susan Sontag, Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes, Julio CortÃ¡zar, Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, among others. The fallout from its publication was atrocious, including accusations that Vargas Llosa worked for the C.I.A., as well as the beginning of the disintegration of his close friendship with GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez.
âBut at the same time I felt a great freedom, you know?â Vargas Llosa told me. âBecause until then âyou canât give weapons to the enemy.â So you had to swallow all kinds of frogs and snakesâ â the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the labor camps in Cuba â âbut after the Padilla affair, I never again swallowed a frog or snake.â
Vargas Llosaâs break with Castro precipitated a fundamental reconstruction of his political beliefs. By 1982 he was having dinner with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the classical liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin at the home of the historian Hugh Thomas in London. This political conversion had an impact on his literary reputation. Gerald Martin, who wrote the definitive biography of GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez and is now working on another about Vargas Llosa, believes it was the most important factor keeping him from a Nobel win. âIt was generally believed before with Lundkvistâ â Artur Lundkvist, an influential member of the Swedish Academy â âthat he preferred the Socialist, Marxist, Communist, radical, progressive writers,â Martin told me. Vargas Llosa received the prize for literature only after the Nobel committee had changed by the early 2000s.
It didnât help that Vargas Llosaâs beliefs were often subject to gross distortion. Carlos GranÃ©s, the editor who assembled âSabers and Utopias,â told me that he once heard the Peruvian author Dante Castro Arrasco declare that if Vargas Llosa had become president of Peru, he would have replaced the national coat of arms with a swastika. In truth, Vargas Llosaâs politics are closer to libertarian, and he has denounced every Latin American authoritarian of his lifetime. âSabers and Utopiasâ shows him inveighing against not only leftists like Hugo ChÃ¡vez in Venezuela but also Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Chile and the Peronist military dictatorship in Argentina.
âMario Vargas Llosa has been a central figure â central, central, central â for democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms,â JosÃ© Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director of Human Rights Watch, told me. âI donât think Iâm exaggerating. Heâs some sort of father of the current Peruvian democracy.â
âI think that one of the things he loves about New York,â Gallo told me, âis that he can walk, he can go into any restaurant for dinner. Itâs funny because generally the people who recognize him, when Iâve been with him, are the Latin American waiters.â Shortly after Vargas Llosa received the Nobel in 2010, however, he and Gallo were almost crushed on Princetonâs campus by thousands of Peruvians who swarmed them after a public event. Most of them lived in nearby Paterson, N.J. Gallo recalled them shouting: 
The mobs were not always so friendly when Vargas Llosa campaigned for president of Peru in the 1990 election. His house received bomb threats. His van was attacked. Members of his political party, the Freedom Movement, were murdered. His candidacy had emerged unexpectedly in 1987, after he penned a vitriolic op-ed against President Alan GarcÃ­aâs plan to nationalize Peruâs banks. Soon after, Vargas Llosa stopped writing fiction to create the Freedom Movement. His eldest son, Ãlvaro Vargas Llosa, then 23, became the campaign spokesman.
Vargas Llosaâs platform attracted new people to Peruvian politics, including the corporate executive Beatriz Merino, who later served as prime minister of Peru. But most Peruvians were fed up with political parties. During the 1980s, the incompetence of Peruâs political class had turned the country into a nightmare. Terrorist groups killed some 17,000 people and controlled large swaths of the sierras. Hyperinflation hit 7,650 percent in 1990. At least one-third of the countryâs population lived in poverty. Vargas Llosaâs call to reduce state subsidies terrified many of these citizens, as did his connections to the rich, white elite that dominated Peru like an oligarchy. Nevertheless, for much of the campaign, polls predicted a Vargas Llosa win. Then, in the final laps of the campaign, an unknown agricultural engineer named Alberto Fujimori started closing in.
Fujimori mocked and attacked Vargas Llosa relentlessly, drawing attention to his agnosticism, his international connections, his earnest intellectualism and his racy novels. A son of cotton pickers from Japan, he presented himself as an outsider who would defend Peruâs poor and working class from a foreign neoliberal âeconomic shock.â Fujimori himself sometimes appeared on a tractor. He had a gift for vague, emotionally resonant statements. But Fujimori won only because Peruâs leftists and centrists swung behind him for the sole purpose of sinking Vargas Llosa. Then almost immediately after he took office, Fujimori pivoted right and implemented a version of the âeconomic shockâ that Vargas Llosa had recommended. This reversal depended on the collaboration of the same economists, lawyers and business owners who had rallied around the Freedom Movement. But by 1992 â after Fujimori used tanks to shut down Peruâs Congress because it resisted his reforms â it became obvious that many of Vargas Llosaâs former supporters did not feel as strongly about freedom as he did.
Fujimori foreshadowed a new wave of authoritarians in Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia. The political scientists Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way have coined a term for this kind of regime: âcompetitive authoritarianism.â On paper, it looks a lot like democracy. In practice, it operates more like autocracy. Yet Fujimoriâs popularity remained high for much of the 1990s. As Vargas Llosa predicted, economic reforms finished hyperinflation. And in 1992, Peruvian police officers captured the leader of the most grotesquely violent guerrilla group in Latin American history, the Shining Path, allowing them to dismantle it. These two triumphs are why some Peruvians claim that Fujimori âsavedâ Peru, even though his government formed military death squads, suspended habeas corpus, crushed the free press, mishandled a cholera epidemic, sterilized thousands of indigenous women, blackmailed opponents and fomented widespread corruption.
Sitting over a glass of tomato juice at the Four Seasons, Vargas Llosa emphasized that he never worked against Fujimori until he brought out the tanks. âNot only did I respect the election, I was one of the first to congratulate Fujimori, to wish him luck,â Vargas Llosa said. âAnd during the two years that he governed legally as president, I did not make the most minimal opposition.â But when Fujimori shut down Congress, Vargas Llosa became his enemy. He asked the international community to cut off aid to Fujimori and noted (correctly) that Latin American militaries often favor coups dâÃ©tat. In response, Fujimoriâs head of the armed forces, NicolÃ¡s de Bari Hermoza, suggested that Vargas Llosa was deliberately harming Peruvians. Ãlvaro Vargas Llosa told me that they learned of a plan to strip the entire Vargas Llosa family of its Peruvian citizenship. Mario appealed to Spain, and in 1993 it granted him citizenship. In Peru, this event was widely perceived as the petulant betrayal of a sore loser.
If you have never read Vargas Llosa before, this is the place to start. Gorgeous and harrowing, âThe Feast of the Goatâ is also the most accessible of his great political fictions. Here his taste for baroque narrative multiplicity has been simplified to just a handful of perspectives, and Edith Grossmanâs translation is superb. Trujillo, Vargas Llosa writes, is an âastute exploiter of menâs vanity, greed and stupidity.â Almost every character collaborates with him as long as they believe that he can help them gain power or money. Even the man who organizes Trujilloâs assassination first guards the dictatorâs life. Trujillo nevertheless murders his brother and destroys his reputation. Trujillo had killed him in stages, the man reflects later, âtaking away his decency, his honor, his self-respect, his joy in living, his hopes and desires, turning him into a sack of bones tormented by a guilty conscience that had been destroying him gradually for so many years.â
Fujimoriâs regime came apart the same year that âThe Feast of the Goatâ was published in Spanish. On Sept. 14, 2000, the media aired footage of Fujimoriâs head of secret intelligence, Vladimiro Montesinos, paying a congressman $15,000 to switch to Fujimoriâs party. Two months after the tape surfaced, Fujimori made an unscheduled trip to Japan and faxed his resignation from a Tokyo hotel room. By then more than $50 million had been located in foreign bank accounts in Montesinosâs name. Five years later, Fujimori was arrested in Chile, and he was eventually extradited to Peru. In 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for, among other atrocities, his role in creating a death squad that murdered an 8-year-old boy.
Ãlvaro moved back to Lima during the final year of Fujimoriâs regime to join the democratic resistance, and after Fujimoriâs collapse, Vargas Llosaâs influence in Peru soared. In 2011, father and son used their new political capital to derail the presidential hopes of Fujimoriâs daughter, Keiko. To defeat her, Keikoâs opponents rallied behind Ollanta Humala, a man Hugo ChÃ¡vez endorsed in Peruâs 2006 election. After interviewing Humala in Vargas Llosaâs office, Ãlvaro helped arrange a public meeting at which Humala swore a democratic oath. Vargas Llosa sent a video endorsement that played at the event. âIf Vargas Llosa had not supported Ollanta Humala against Keiko Fujimori, Ollanta Humala would not have won,â the Peruvian political scientist Alberto Vergara told me. âThey moderated Humala so that he could win the runoff.â
âHalf the country hated us, obviously,â Ãlvaro said. âAnd until this day they wonât forgive us. But in the end I think that what they wonât forgive us is that we were right.â Humala did not become an authoritarian. When his term in office ended, he stepped down. He is now in jail awaiting trial for corruption.
As the cocktail hour dragged on, Vargas Llosa became restless. âItâs marvelous to sit or to walk,â he said, âbut standing around is horrible.â He is a man who likes to be doing, not waiting, and I got the sense that for him and Preysler all their charming, pre-awards chitchat was a kind of necessary work. Finally the bells chimed for dinner. Vargas Llosa escorted Preysler to the meal on his arm.
In our conversations, Vargas Llosa declined to discuss his romantic entanglements. When I asked him what had fractured his marriage to Patricia Llosa, which produced three children, he dropped all his smiles and chuckles. âLook,â he said, âthat topic has to do with love. Love is probably the most enriching experience that a human being can have. Nothing transforms a personâs life as much as love. At the same time, love is a private experience. If itâs made public, it becomes cheap, shoddy, full of commonplaces. This is why itâs so hard to write about love in literature. You have to find the most clever ways so that it doesnât lose its authenticity and become commonplace. So I think that a person shouldnât talk about love precisely if love is so important in his life.â
Youâre a romantic, I said.
âI think we all are. I think that romanticism has marked our lives very much, that itâs very difficult not to be romantic in some way, although many of us donât realize it. You live it or you reject it. You vaccinate yourself against it. Letâs say that I havenât rejected it. When itâs happened, Iâve lived it.â
The first time he lived it was in 1955, when he eloped with his auntâs sister, Julia Urquidi Illanes. At the time, Vargas Llosa was a 19-year-old university student, and Urquidi was a 29-year-old divorcÃ©e. Ernesto Vargas was so enraged by their marriage that he threatened to kill Mario. But the couple refused to divorce. The day Ernesto accepted the marriage, Vargas Llosa writes in his memoir, marked his âdefinitive emancipationâ from his father. But nine years later, they divorced, and a year after, in 1965, he married his first cousin Patricia Llosa Urquidi, Juliaâs niece. In her memoir, âWhat Varguitas Didnât Say,â Julia suggests the cousins began their romance when Patricia visited them in Paris in 1960, when Mario was 24 and Patricia was 15.
Forty-five years into their marriage, Vargas Llosa declared in his Nobel lecture that Patricia âdoes everything and does everything well. She solves problems, manages the economy, imposes order on chaos, keeps journalists and intrusive people at bay, defends my time, decides appointments and trips, packs and unpacks suitcases and is so generous that even when she thinks she is rebuking me, she pays me the highest compliment: âMario, the only thing youâre good for is writing.âââ The year she turned 70, however, he left her for Preysler.
âWhat you have to understand about him is that heâs a person who gives himself with absolute passion to what he believes in, even when he is wrong,â Ãlvaro told me. Of all Vargas Llosaâs children, Ãlvaro has been the most accepting of his fatherâs new relationship, perhaps because their ties go far beyond the familial. Vargas Llosaâs daughter, Morgana, a photographer and documentary filmmaker who lives in Peru, told me that she was shocked when Vargas Llosa appeared with Preysler in the Spanish-language celebrity weekly Â¡Hola! just days after the entire family had gathered to celebrate Patricia and Marioâs 50th anniversary. Now she takes the situation more stoically. âSeeing how marriages fall apart after two, three, five or 10 years, I think itâs an absolute success to have shared a life together for 50 years,â she said.
But Vargas Llosaâs younger son, Gonzalo, who works with the United Nations in Britain, still reels from the way Mario handled the divorce. âWe had a very special and very close relationship, and I love him greatly,â he told me. But he was enormously disappointed when Mario told Â¡Hola! that his first year with Preysler had been the happiest year of his life. âIf the year in which you leave your wife of 50 years and you donât speak to your son is the happiest year of your life, well, that doesnât say a great deal about whatever he may have really felt,â Gonzalo told me. âSo this is fine to think, but why say it publicly? This what I find distasteful but also hurtful.â
Divorce, and its painful aftermath, can happen in any family. But what galls many people, including Gonzalo, is that Preysler embodies the celebrity entertainment culture that Vargas Llosa long claimed to abhor. A woman of feline poise and beauty, she has shrewdly parlayed tabloid attention into a kind of proto-Kardashian career: hosting television shows, promoting luxury goods like Rabat jewelry and Porcelanosa tiles. Their social life is now extensively documented by Â¡Hola!, where Preysler herself once worked, as well as by many less savory gossip sheets. A quick online search turns up images of the couple sailing on the Costa Azul, watching bullfighting in Seville and attending parties at Dumfries House with Prince Charles.
âThere are hundreds of publications, radio and television programs, that feed a kind of morbid curiosity that consists of basically revealing the private lives of people,â Vargas Llosa told me in Madrid. âMany people are delighted. On the contrary, itâs a real profession to show your privacy. Itâs a kind of striptease, no, of a life, especially sexual, erotic. And itâs a world that literally produces horror in me.â
This âprofessionâ is Preyslerâs, however, and as long as they are together it will be, in some way, Vargas Llosaâs profession as well. In December the Spanish edition of Harperâs Bazaar magazine published a soft-focus video of the couple embracing and talking about their life together â precisely the sort of thing that, to listen to Vargas Llosa, âliterally produces horrorâ in him. This sudden, major gap between what Vargas Llosa says and what he does reminds me of a conversation we had about his puckish character Fonchito, a boy with the face of an angel and a taste for Egon Schiele. In âThe Discreet Heroâ (2013), Fonchito develops an interest in religion and asks his father, Don Rigoberto, âCould you tell me what this Sodom and Gomorrah is, Papa?â
Sometimes I wonder if Fonchito is your alter-ego, I said to Vargas Llosa.
âWho knows?â he said, chuckling. âHeâs a character who disturbs me a bit because I donât really understand him very well.â A moment later he added, âI canât tell if heâs really so innocent or if heâs concealing something or if itâs a way of behaving thatâs clever, no?â
Fonchito first appeared in Vargas Llosaâs erotic comedies âIn Praise of the Stepmotherâ (1988) and âThe Notebooks of Don Rigobertoâ (1997). Most critics ignore these libertine novels when they discuss Vargas Llosaâs work. His own fans tend to regard them with either distaste or hilarity. But the skittishness about sex has kept readers and critics from appreciating how erotics pervade all of Vargas Llosaâs fiction. Even the novels that are best known for their political dissections are filled with a kind of transgressive sexual realism: scenes in brothels, secret homosexual affairs, rapes. âPeople donât tend to think of him as an erotic writer, but his literary project is so interesting in part because of the way it connects sexuality with politics,â Gallo told me. âI think there is an idea, and heâs said as much, that a dictatorship affects all the levels of citizensâ lives, including the sexual sphere.â
Nowhere has this connection been as explicit, or as graphic, as in Vargas Llosaâs latest novel, âThe Neighborhood.â The story opens with best friends Marisa and Chabela in bed. A few pages in we find the words âperspire,â âclitoris,â âscratchingâ and âhappinessâ â their platonic evening has transformed into a lesbian affair. In Vargas Llosaâs opinion, this scene, and the novelâs many other triple-X plot twists, realistically capture the bedroom adventures that occurred during the darkest part of the Fujimori years. Limaâs authoritarian curfew, which forbade residents to travel through the city at night, turned many dinners and parties into spontaneous sleepovers, he told me, with some inevitably kinky consequences.
âIn those periods of tension, of terrible aggravation, eroticism often springs up as a compensation, no?â he said. âItâs a way of distracting oneself, of losing oneself. Itâs like the idea of the end of the world. The world is ending: All sins are allowed.â
âCommunism has destroyed itself by its total incapacity to fulfill all the expectations that were put into this system to bring prosperity, justice, happiness, culture to a society,â he said in English. âBut populism is much more difficult to fight because itâs not an ideology, not a system with principles, with ideas that we can refute rationally.â
As recently as three years ago, it seemed as if Vargas Llosaâs political values had conquered the world. Almost everywhere in Latin America, the totalitarian regimes that he opposed had collapsed â while free markets, democracy and sexual liberation found favor. But in 2016, the tide seemed to change. During our conversations, he recalled feeling astonished during a visit to England shortly before the vote on Brexit. For Vargas Llosa, London had long been a model of how polyglot pluralism, democracy and free markets should work together. Yet there was Boris Johnson on his hotel television, shamelessly declaring that Britainâs payments to the European Union subsidized bullfights in Spain.
âTo lie so brazenly, so cynically,â Vargas Llosa told me. âWell, I was amazed.â He never imagined that such retrograde tactics could work in Britain. âNow,â he said, âitâs been proved that no country is really vaccinated against demagogy or populism.â In Europe, itâs easy to name major political figures, like Angela Merkel in Germany, who embrace the principles of liberal economics while also defending a liberal society. Thatâs rare in Latin America. âThe attraction to a caudillo is a characteristic that many Latin American countries share,â the Peruvian journalist Diego Salazar told me. âAnd not just Latin Americans. In fact, President Trump is the first Latin American president of the United States in that respect.â
In 2016, Keiko Fujimori lost the presidency by only 0.2 percent of the vote, and her party, Popular Force, gained a majority in Congress that she has used, in true competitive-authoritarian fashion, to attack her strongest opponents. In late December, Popular Force nearly deposed President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in a legislative coup. Kuczynski was saved only by the intercession of Alberto Fujimori and his son, Kenji, who persuaded nine congressmen to sit out the key vote. Soon after, Kuczynski granted Alberto a Christmas Eve pardon. Itâs widely believed that the abstentions were quid pro quo for this release.
âWe have always had to choose between the lesser of two evils,â Gustavo Gorriti, editor of the investigative-news outlet IDL-Reporteros, said about Peruvians. âAnd we have had substandard democratic candidates, which we chose to elect just in order to avoid the return to the Fujimori dictatorship.â But the Fujimoris are now essentially in power â Kuczynskiâs political survival depends upon their favor â and Peruâs loose coalition of democratically minded forces may not pull off another win in the 2021 elections.
Vargas Llosaâs own role in these battles is diminishing. The pain and friction of his unexpected divorce have estranged him from Peru and strained many of his old friendships. He does not travel to Lima as often or stay long when he goes. The apartment where Ãlvaro met with Humala now belongs solely to Patricia Llosa, who has dismantled Vargas Llosaâs office and is turning it into a TV room. His political opinions will always matter in Lima, but now that he has opted to join Preyslerâs jet set, they will carry less weight. Gonzalo Vargas Llosa predicted this shift at the start of his fatherâs affair. âHe was a god for me not just because I loved him as a father,â he told me, âbut because I thought he was the most brilliant and important and inspiring intellectual that I had ever come across or read about. And when I see a Nobel Prize winner giving interviews to Â¡Hola!, I feel sad that he has allowed himself to become part of a world which is intellectually so absolutely poor.â
Nothing may transform a life as much as love, but Vargas Llosa has always been hard to comprehend. Heâs a modernist and a comedian, a politician and an aesthete, an intellectual and a libertine. Writing was not simply a refuge from or a rebellion against Ernesto, he told me in Preyslerâs garden; it was âa way of revealing myself to be different from what he wanted me to be.â His whole life has been a series of these startling revelations. Perhaps we all contain multitudes, but Vargas Llosa has put his contradictions into action, in his life and on the page.

That was fast. A day after stocks rallied after the announcement of a truce in the U.S.-China trade war, they bombed again: The S&P 500 lost more than 3 percent on Tuesday. But donât believe anyone who points to a single reason for the rout.
The draft of a report prepared for the board of CBS by lawyers for the company, and 
Among the revelations in the document:
â¢ Mr. Moonves âengaged in multiple acts of serious nonconsensual sexual misconduct in and outside of the workplace, both before and after he came to CBS in 1995.â Some of those allegations had not been previously disclosed.
â¢ Lawyers involved in the inquiry spoke with Mr. Moonves four times and found him to be âevasive and untruthful at times, and to have deliberately lied about and minimized the extent of his sexual misconduct.â
â¢ Investigators determined that Mr. Moonves had âreceived oral sex from at least 4 CBS employees under circumstances that sound transactional and improper to the extent that there was no hint of any relationship, romance or reciprocity.â
The report also explains what the CBS board and management knew about Mr. Moonvesâs conduct. More on what that means from the 
Many of the companyâs employees, including high-ranking executives and even members of its board, were aware of the former chief executive Leslie Moonvesâs alleged sexual misconduct and subsequent efforts to conceal it. Yet no one acted to stop him â and the repercussions for that failure are likely to reverberate at CBS for years.
President Trump repeatedly accused Amazon in the spring of engaging in a âscamâ against the United States Postal Service. On Tuesday, his administration delivered its verdict: not really.
More on that from 
The task force created by Mr. Trump to investigate the Postal Serviceâs finances did conclude that the mail system is losing money. But 
Commercial package delivery is not profitable enough to offset the revenue losses the Postal Service is suffering, however, as Americans mail fewer and fewer first-class letters.
The report did recommend some changes: that the Postal Service change the price of package delivery to maximize profit instead of maximizing delivery volume, and that it create separate accounting books for letters and for packages, among other things. Such changes could increase delivery prices, making 
Itâs been two weeks since Mr. Ghosn, who led an alliance comprising Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, was arrested in Japan, and there hasnât been much clarity on how he might have sneaked $70 million of salary and benefits past the company that pays him, as he is suspected of doing.
Now 
What is certain is that Nissan Motor Co.âs own corporate governance rules gave unusual powers to its former chairman, a business celebrity who was given extraordinary deference for having once rescued the automaker from financial ruin. Those powers included near-total say over how much â and how â he was paid, according to Nissanâs own internal rules.
Several people familiar with the prosecutorsâ investigation now say the probe appears to hinge on a relatively arcane point of accounting â whether retirement payments were properly booked.
The Bloomberg report also points to questionable governance at Nissan, with a concentration of power at the top and independent board members, including an âex-race-car driver and former model,â who may not have been qualified to ask searching questions of the leadership team.

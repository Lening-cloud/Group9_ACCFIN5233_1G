Bank of America quietly announced this week that its investment-banking chief, Christian Meissner, would step down by the end of the year. Now we may know why: He questioned the firm’s commitment to being a top-ranked investment bank, 
After buying Merrill Lynch a decade ago, it appeared eager. But in recent years its appetite for risk seems to have diminished: It avoided some plum work, like advising on Saudi Aramco’s I.P.O., and has slid down the rankings of M.&A. advisers.
When Mr. Meissner leaves, other senior bankers may soon follow. But the C.E.O., Brian Moynihan, probably won’t lose much sleep: Investment banking is just a sliver of overall revenue; it’s still winning top mandates; and the bank’s shares are up 27 percent year-over-year.
The e-commerce giant announced a 
But that’s necessary. Amazon enjoyed an early lead in the voice assistant market, beating Google to the smart speaker market by almost two years and Apple by three. But Google has been catching up, and 
Amazon also lacks deep smartphone integration for Alexa, because it doesn’t have its own phone ecosystem like Apple and Google do. So its plan is to put Alexa everywhere else.
The S.&P. 500 rose 0.8 percent yesterday to set an all-time high. The Dow Jones industrial average also set a record. That puts them on track to exceed Wall Street’s expectations for 2018.
The performance is buoyed by a U.S. economy that continues to improve. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates next week. And even with unemployment at its lowest level in almost two decades, initial jobless claims — a measure of layoffs — fell this week to their lowest level since 1969.
There’s plenty going on that could upset things, including trade disputes and economic jitters. But 
Mr. Moonves was forced out as the CBS chairman and C.E.O. amid sexual misconduct accusations. But Jim Stewart of the NYT points out that he may still collect $120 million in severance if the broadcaster 
Mere allegations of sexual misconduct, which now have been made publicly against Mr. Moonves by 12 women, do not constitute cause. Nor is it likely that behavior that occurred before he joined CBS could be considered a violation of any company policy. Mr. Moonves has denied any improper behavior. He says that any sexual activity was consensual and, for the most part, occurred before he came to CBS.
CBS’s board knows that it’s in a bind. Paying Mr. Moonves anything would create a P.R. headache, but refusing to pay could kick-start a messy legal fight. Those may be its only options.
After President Trump announced his travel ban in January 2017, Google employees wondered if the company’s search engine could be modified in order to direct people to pro-immigration groups, or show them ways to campaign against the policy. Here’s more from 
Email traffic, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, shows that employees proposed ways to “leverage” search functions and take steps to counter what they considered to be “islamophobic, algorithmically biased results from search terms ‘Islam’, ‘Muslim’, ‘Iran’, etc.” and “prejudiced, algorithmically biased search results from search terms ‘Mexico’, ‘Hispanic’, ‘Latino’, etc.”
A Google spokesperson told the newspaper that they were ideas that were never implemented.
The investment giant caused surprise two years ago when it unveiled its $2 billion Rise fund, dedicated to investing in companies that help society. Now the firm is 
Rise is the biggest example of Wall Street’s push into social impact investing. It is based on what TPG says is a complex model to measure a company’s success on that front. Interest in the fund is said to be high. But TPG executives told Michael that they want other private equity titans to move into the space, which would give impact investing more clout.
With a federal investigation, a long line of departing senior executives, and fears about an unpredictable C.E.O., it’s easy to forget about Tesla’s dire financial situation. But Bill Cohan explains in 
Tesla’s finances are fragile. It has around $11 billion in long-term debt and no profits. “That is not a sustainable business model,” Jim Collins, a longtime auto industry research analyst, wrote in Forbes in April. “Not even close.” From January to June of this year, Tesla generated revenues of $7.4 billion, but it had an operating loss of $1.7 billion, burning through its cash on hand. It has $2.2 billion left, most of which will be needed to cover operating losses. Romit Shah, a research analyst at Nomura Instinet and once one of Tesla’s biggest boosters, reversed course last week, calling the company “no longer investable.”

The Golden State hopes to increase the number of women sitting on corporate boards by requiring companies based there to meet a quota for female directors. It’s a worthy goal, but Andrew worries that 
Why? California’s legislature concedes that the law could be unconstitutional. Its requirements may not apply to companies chartered elsewhere. (A big loophole: By one estimate, the only Fortune 500 company affected is Apple.) And sudden disruption could hurt companies’ performance.
Joe Grundfest of Stanford, a longtime advocate for increasing board diversity, said of the move, “I fear the cure is worse than the disease.”
Andrew’s suggestion? Individual investors, big and small, pressing boards to diversify:
Firms like BlackRock and pension funds like Calpers, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, are already working to effect change. BlackRock has told companies that it wants to see at least two female board members at the companies it invests in. Calpers wrote to 504 companies in 2017 asking them to improve diversity, and has voted against directors at companies that have failed to respond to its requests. Hopefully, the constant drumbeat on this topic will only drive additional responsible companies to make progress.

Mr. Flannery was supposed to turn G.E.’s fortunes around. But like his predecessor, Jeff Immelt, he’ll be handing over a lot of problems: G.E. says it is taking a $23 billion write-down in its power business, and its financial arm and pension fund are messes.
Now, for the first time, G.E.’s board is 
G.E. shares rose 7 percent yesterday, suggesting at least some investors are confident that Mr. Culp can deliver another miracle. The company 
The dust has settled on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — the successor to Nafta — so it’s time to consider it in detail. Jim Tankersley of the NYT explains 
But for Mr. Trump, the deal with America’s second- and third-largest trading partners clears the way for 
A renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement, Trump advisers argue, removes the possibility that a trade war could break out on the continent and will make North America a more attractive place for investment.
When combined with U.S. tariffs against China, which boost the costs of production there, foreign companies will start moving investment out of China, the administration calculates. That would weaken China’s ability to produce next-generation technology and put additional pressure on Beijing to make trade concessions sought by the U.S.
Mr. Trump appears happy to play a long game. “China wants to talk very badly,” he said at a news conference yesterday. “I said frankly it’s too early to talk, because they’re not ready.”
Rows of new vehicles made by Elon Musk’s electric car company are 
Mr. Musk had long promised that the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000. But the least costly version available now starts at $49,000, and the price nears $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot driver-assistance software and other options. The company has said that more than 400,000 customers are waiting to buy Model 3 sedans, and that each paid a $1,000 deposit. Many who put down deposits may be waiting for the more affordable base model.
Charles Schwab turned his budget-basement retail brokerage into an investment giant that manages over $3.6 trillion of customer money. But fintech start-ups are after those customers.

While tech is becoming ever more dominant, Bettinger says the human element is what will help the company ward off the threats posed by online competitors. When it comes to financial services, he says, clients ultimately want to talk to a live person — in a web chat, on the phone, or at a branch office. In 2016, less than a year after introducing its robo-adviser, Charles Schwab began offering fee-based personal consultations for accounts of at least $25,000.
Companies such as Ant Financial or Amazon, which analysts have speculated will eventually move into finance, would be challenged to build those kinds of offerings at Charles Schwab’s scale, Bettinger says. “I’d like to think that we’re a blend of Amazon and Nordstrom,” he says.
Applicant numbers have been falling for years — but now 
Harvard Business School received 9,886 applications for this fall’s entering class, down 4.5 percent from last year — the biggest drop since 2005. Applications to Wharton fell 6.7 percent to 6,245. At Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, they slid 4.6 percent to 7,797. Such top schools are still receiving many more applications than they can accept, but the declines mark a reversal after years of growth.
Reasons for the slump? Rising college debt has made M.B.A.s too expensive for many people, and higher hurdles for work visas have pushed foreign students to international schools instead.
For nearly a decade, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Vinod Khosla has waged an unusually high-profile legal battle over a beach access path that cuts through a coastal village he owns near Half Moon Bay, Calif. He wanted it closed. But while he lost the fight, 
Nellie Bowles of the NYT explains why:
As the case wound its way up to the Supreme Court, it threatened to gut California’s Coastal Act of 1976, which enshrines public access to beaches as a right.
“If I were to ever win in the Supreme Court, I’d be depressed about it,” he told The New York Times this year. “I support the Coastal Act; I don’t want to weaken it by winning. But property rights are even more important.”

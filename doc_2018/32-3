The Japanese company became the most powerful tech investor in the world when Saudi Arabia pledged $45 billion to its Vision Fund. But outcry over the disappearance and suspected killing of a Saudi journalist has cast a cloud over SoftBankâs alliance with the country.
Many prominent businesses, including JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, have tried to distance themselves from a big Saudi investment conference. But SoftBank has not. 
It is a delicate balance for Mr. Son, who is on the one hand receiving investment capital from a conservative nation that built its vast wealth with oil and on the other hand using that very wealth to fund progressive young companies with a different set of values.
The Saudis seem aware of the power they hold over SoftBank. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who led the countryâs investment in the Vision Fund â and whom 
But SoftBank is considering a worst-case scenario: It may have to refuse any more Saudi money.

The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point last month, to a range between 2 percent and 2.25 percent. And itâs broadly expected to raise it again by a quarter of a point in December.
A majority of Fed officials predicted in September that the central bank would raise its benchmark interest rate to a mildly restrictive level, above 3 percent, by the second half of next year. Beyond that, things are less certain, 
The Fed remains uncertain about its plans for the coming year, and one reason is that Fed officials also are concerned that Mr. Trumpâs trade policies could impede economic growth, the minutes said. The Fed has said Mr. Trumpâs policies, including tariffs on steel, aluminum and a wide range of Chinese goods, have not yet dented aggregate measures of economic growth.

The president wants to clamp down on extremely low shipping rates that Chinese companies pay to send goods to America, which he has argued have been unfair to their U.S. rivals. (The White House doesnât need permission from Congress to withdraw, though it could rescind the move if it negotiates new postal rates within the next year.)
The White House has, however, shied away from opening another, more controversial front in the trade war: The Treasury Department chose 
Alex Stamos, Facebookâs former security chief.
The Democratic National Committee was hugely unprepared for a series of Russian hacks during the 2016 campaign that stole emails, strategy documents and other internal records from its servers. With the midterms approaching, 
Krikorianâs team regularly discusses emerging threats with experts at Microsoft, Facebook, Google and other tech firms. They chat via the encrypted messaging apps Signal and Wickr with cyber experts from the DNCâs sister committees and third-party vendors, discussing suspicious incidents and other information. The DNC also works with Facebook and Twitter to ensure the committee learns when candidates contact social media firms about possible account takeovers.
But Alex Stamos, Facebookâs former security chief, is skeptical that campaigns have done enough. âWe have not seen the kind of massive upgrade in campaign infrastructure that you would need to stand against a professional hacking agency like that,â he told

Thatâs a tough margin for Mr. Loeb to overcome in his effort to oust the companyâs entire board. The activist investor has said that Campbellâs poor performance shows it needs new oversight â and a plan to sell itself.
All hope isnât lost for Mr. Loeb. Campbellâs corporate bylaws state that whichever board candidate receives the most votes wins, so some of Third Pointâs nominees 
Prudential, whose shares rose about 2 percent Wednesday, has more total assets today than when it was designated a SIFI. Regulators acknowledged Wednesday it also has greater derivatives exposures and a complex legal structure that could make it hard to unwind in a crisis.
Jeremy Kress, a University of Michigan professor who opposed the move, told the WSJ that regulators had signaled that âother firms can grow with impunity without having to worry about this type of regulation.â
Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain
Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain briefed her fellow E.U. leaders yesterday on the state of Brexit talks, before her peers discussed what they had heard over dinner. Their verdict? They plan to delay a special Brexit meeting next month because not enough progress has been made. 
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, noted that talks had hit a âdeadlockâ and other leaders expressed frustration at political paralysis in Westminster, according to diplomats briefed on the meeting.
Michel Barnier, the E.U.âs chief Brexit negotiator, reportedly said: âWe need time, we need much more time, and we will continue to work in the next weeks calmly and patiently.â

The Federal Reserve did all it could to telegraph 
That’s good news for those who will be borrowing for homes or cars, but it’s a bad signal for the economy as a whole, because it suggests that economic weakness may be coming. It’s particularly bad news for Mr. Trump, who could find himself running for re-election in a slowdown or even a recession. After four years in office, it’s going to be very hard for him to pin that on Mr. Obama or the Democrats.

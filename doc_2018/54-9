The death of Fairfax has been pronounced so many times that we are nearly numb to it. But today’s announced Nine takeover, if it completes, really will mark the end of a 177-year history, and is a heavy blow for quality, independent journalism and for media diversity in this country.
It’s not nearly as much as once suggested, but Blackstone raised $4.6 billion as of June 30 so far for its infrastructure fund, Kate Kelly tells us. Half came from an earlier matching commitment from Saudi Arabia — so other outside investors put in $2.3 billion.

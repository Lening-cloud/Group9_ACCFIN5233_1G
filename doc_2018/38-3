A Morgan Stanley survey of 101 investors and 168 bank loan officers indicates that although investors believe their financing decisions are balanced, in reality they are highly skewed:
• Nearly 80 percent said they think minority and women business owners get either the appropriate amount of capital or more, considering what their business models suggest they deserve.
• The median investment by equity investors in all businesses is nearly $1 million. For those owned by women, it’s just $213,000. And for minority-owned companies, it’s $185,000.
• Investors could do more to change the dynamic. Of those polled, nearly 40 percent of men said investing in businesses owned by women was not a priority; 31 percent of white investors said it was not a priority to invest in minority-owned businesses.

If you wanted to stitch together a narrative to explain all this, I would say intensifying worries about world trade, a number of different data points, and the rising political risks in Europe prompted a sell-off in stocks outside the U.S., but also helped to engineer a sufficient downward shift in rate expectations to trigger buying in the U.S. That rescued the tech sector, but it left the financials, which are not helped by lower rates or a flat yield curve, in an even worse state.
While much of Silicon Valley has tied itself in knots over whether to take on government contracts, one company is pressing on. Palantir, which uses software to analyze data and was founded with the help of $2 million from the C.I.A.’s venture capital arm, 
H.S.I., which is responsible for fighting transnational criminal organizations that illegally exploit U.S. travel, trade, financial and immigration systems, uses Palantir software for data analysis. Employees of Microsoft, Google and Amazon have all lobbied their companies not to pursue government contracts; the Palantir news may stoke further conversation in Silicon Valley about the ethics of doing such work.
In an emailed statement, Palantir told DealBook:
There are two major divisions of ICE with two distinct mandates: Homeland Security Investigations, or H.S.I., is responsible for cross-border criminal investigations. The other major directorate, Enforcement and Removal Operations, or E.R.O., is responsible for interior civil immigration enforcement, including deportation and detention of undocumented immigrants. We do not work for E.R.O.

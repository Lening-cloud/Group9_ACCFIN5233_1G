We were all running late for our Adelaide Writers’ Week discussion of democracy and populism, and when I saw the crowd of 400 people waiting for us on Monday morning, I was suddenly surprised and impressed at the level of interest. (A bit nervous, too.)
As the moderator, I set the scene. Democracy is in retreat, I said, in Hungary, Venezuela, Turkey and many other countries, as our 
I also noted the 
Over all last year, I said, 71 countries suffered declines in political rights and civil liberties while 35 registered gains, according to 
Pretty depressing, right?
Well, so it goes in the world today.
And yet, our public discussion (which followed a chat, a day earlier, with Clive Hamilton about China’s influence in Australia) ranged widely from the causes to possible solutions to signs of both despair and hope.
A few of the highlights and themes worthy of further examination:
Both Professor Grayling and Mr. Megalogenis lamented the way that politics now struggles to draw in the best and brightest minds. For those who are ambitious and want to change the world, I also noted, there’s more interest in tech start-ups than in government.
What can or should our leaders do to make representative democracy feel more dynamic and relevant?
Professor Grayling suggested that strict term limits would be one way to help, by making politics a temporary service rather than a career. Another idea that came up: recruiting a more diverse pool of candidates, tapping into the optimism of immigrant communities and their children, who tend not to be underrepresented in Australian politics.
Social media and big data: Good or bad? How about both.
They allow for niche targeting of voters, which usually means the undecided, but in the case of Britain’s decision to withdraw from the European Union, Professor Grayling noted, it also meant encouraging complacency with social media posts telling anti-Brexit voters that there was no way they’d lose, making them less likely to turn out to vote.
At the same time, social media is also now being used by young people to demand change — whether it’s

I’m zealot for transparency, as some of you know, so I paraphrased the inquiry.
Mr. Megalogenis agreed that it was a problem, noting that Australian politicians were continually trying to to avoid transparency and questions — except from friendly journalists.
What he and Professor Grayling concluded was that most of today’s leaders have simply not come to grips with the current moment of existential challenge for democracies: Politicians are still waltzing in a world where the stakes are small and intimately tied to their own party loyalty, their donors and re-election.
What might it take for them to wake up, mature and reinvigorate government?
What needs to happen for the public to be better informed and to demand more from their elected representatives?
These questions came up, too, from me and from the audience. And besides the answer I felt compelled to toss out there (
I’m not sure that’s as satisfying as one would hope. We seem to be in a moment where much of the world is just trying to keep up with the volatility of shifting politics — very little feels settled, and our discussion did little to banish that uncertainty.
But perhaps it was a start. And the discussions will continue, in this newsletter, in The New York Times and beyond.

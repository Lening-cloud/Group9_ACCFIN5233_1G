It’s time for economists to make their predictions for the year ahead. Among the main questions: What are the biggest threats to the U.S. economy, and will the country fall into a recession?
With Carlos Ghosn in a Tokyo jail facing criminal charges of underreporting his income, the automakers have a major problem. Mr. Ghosn masterminded and led the alliance that allowed the two companies to prosper. But, 
• “Mr. Ghosn had not cultivated a clear successor, and that leaves the alliance’s survival in doubt: Neither Nissan nor Renault has a plan for preserving the arrangement that has been a juggernaut.”
• “Mr. Ghosn’s power and unusually long tenure may have prevented the alliance from evolving as Nissan became by far the bigger and more profitable partner, yet Renault exercised more control.”
• “The Renault board said on Thursday that an internal inquiry into Mr. Ghosn’s compensation had uncovered no irregularities, and that he would remain chief executive.” (Reuters says 
• “Nissan’s board will meet on Monday to appoint a replacement for Mr. Ghosn.” (Reuters 
• “With Mr. Ghosn in jail, the most complicated problem for the alliance is that it simply has no leader.”
Tesla has long struggled with production issues on its new Model 3 electric car, and Elon Musk, the carmaker’s C.E.O., is known to have worked hard to overcome them. But 
He walked along the assembly line, red-faced and urgent, interrogating workers he encountered, telling them that at Tesla excellence was a passing grade, and they were failing; that they weren’t smart enough to be working on these problems; that they were endangering the company, according to someone who observed him.
Employees knew about such rampages. Sometimes Musk would terminate people; other times he would simply intimidate them. One manager had a name for these outbursts — Elon’s rage firings — and had forbidden subordinates from walking too close to Musk’s desk at the Gigafactory out of concern that a chance encounter, an unexpected question answered incorrectly, might endanger a career.
When sexual comments by the star of the prime-time CBS drama “Bull,” Michael Weatherly, made the actress Eliza Dushku uncomfortable, she confronted him. Shortly after, she was written out of the show. Believing it to be an act of retaliation, Ms. Dushku went through mediation with CBS and won a $9.5 million settlement.
Her story, which emerged amid an investigation by outside lawyers for CBS into sexual misconduct allegations against Les Moonves, the company’s former C.E.O., is laid out in a draft report 
• “The lawyers said the company’s handling of Ms. Dushku’s complaints was not only misguided, but emblematic of larger problems at CBS.”
• “When faced with instances of wrongdoing, the company had a tendency to protect itself, at the expense of victims, the investigators wrote.”
In a letter to staff members, Richard Handler, the C.E.O. of the investment bank Jeffries, explained that he was vexed by “the thoughtless, paranoid and fundamentally wrong reaction that many people in our industry are expressing about the #MeToo movement.”
• “If you don’t know how to conduct yourself as a responsible, courteous and balanced human being, the fault lies exclusively with you and not with an allegedly flawed system designed to ensnare the innocent,” he wrote.
• His conclusion: “We cannot control the markets, but we can control how we act and behave.”
When President Trump announced a rolling back of car emission regulations this year, automakers said it was too much even for them. But 
• “The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world’s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales.”
• “In Congress, on Facebook and in statehouses nationwide, Marathon Petroleum, the country’s largest refiner, worked with powerful oil-industry groups and a conservative policy network financed by the billionaire industrialist Charles G. Koch to run a stealth campaign to roll back car emissions standards.”
• “The campaign’s main argument for significantly easing fuel efficiency standards — that the United States is so awash in oil it no longer needs to worry about energy conservation — clashed with decades of federal energy and environmental policy.”
Stocks on Wall Street are poised to end the week higher than they started it, with trade tensions between China and the U.S. apparently easing.
But one developing trend has some people concerned: Yesterday, for a fifth straight day, investors sold an early rally, leaving stocks with only modest gains. The 
Year after year of support from global central banks and their multi-trillion dollar asset purchase programmes had indoctrinated the BTD [buy the dip] moneymaking strategy: buy on any sign of a pullback, policymakers have you covered.
But with the Federal Reserve well into a policy tightening cycle and concerns about the U.S.-China trade war weighing on the global growth outlook, investors appear a lot less keen to place their belief — at least for now — that stocks always go up.

LONDON â Prime Minister Theresa Mayâs Conservative government in Britain is in turmoil. But the resignations that have rocked it in recent days â even that of Boris Johnson, who was until recently her 
Why are Britainâs Conservatives so set on that course, despite the fact that access to that market is vital to the prosperity of the country they govern? Because promising to âtake back controlâ of their countryâs borders gradually became the partyâs default response to a challenge that so many of Europeâs center-right parties have been trying to deal with for a decade or more.
The rise of anti-immigrant nationalist insurgencies claiming to represent âthe peopleâ against a corrupt and uncaring political establishment has deep economic, political, social and cultural roots. Yet the reaction of the Continentâs mainstream conservative, market-liberal and Christian democratic parties can be boiled down to four fairly shallow, and equally ineffective, approaches. Only if the center-right fully faces up to the fact that they are all dead ends can it begin to come up with better, more creative and probably more combative ways to deal with the challenge itâs facing. 
The first approach is to try to ignore the populist radical right â and even treat it as some kind of pariah. Thatâs essentially what the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and the Moderates in Sweden did for years. In the end, it hasnât worked.
The far-right, anti-immigrant 
Meanwhile, the fact that the Sweden Democrats originated in that countryâs white supremacist underground didnât prevent them from gaining 13 percent in the 2014 general election. Many predict they will do even better this year, even in the wake of attempts by the Swedish government to strengthen border controls. 
The second approach taken by the center-right is to toughen its stance on migration and multiculturalism, promising to make life more difficult both for those who want to come to the country and for those whoâve already made it. Countries where the center-right has tried this include the France, the Netherlands, Denmark â and Britain.
Again, though, the results havenât exactly been impressive: The far-right National Front made it into the runoff in the 2017 French presidential election. The equally extreme Dutch Party for Freedom hasnât gone away. The Danish Peopleâs Party became Denmarkâs second-biggest party when it took 21 percent of the vote in the 2015 general election â at which point it resumed a role it had already played between 2001 and 2011, namely guaranteeing the survival of a minority government led by the center-right.
In Britain, the Conservative Partyâs decision to try to outflank from the right the U.K. Independence Party, the populist radical-right party that under Nigel Farage (a big fan of Donald Trump) helped bring about Brexit â delivered it only a pyrrhic victory. True, the U.K.I.P.âs vote share plummeted to just 2 percent in 2017 from 13 percent in 2015. But by alienating better-educated, more liberal voters, Mrs. May ended up losing her parliamentary majority. Since then, she has been forced to rely on the support of Northern Irish evangelicals to stay in power â and now, given the disagreements within her own party, even that might not be enough.
The third approach takes this kind of support arrangement to the next level. Since the turn of the century, center-right parties in Italy and Austria have been periodically involved in full-blown coalition with populist radical-right parties, at least partly in the hope that doing so would expose the latter as blowhards incapable of delivering on their ramped-up rhetoric.
Last year saw the Austrian Peopleâs Party, nominally Christian democrats, obliged to invite their radical competitors, the Freedom Party, into government for the second time. And the policy consequences are now becoming clear: The state has been empowered to seize cash and cellphones from asylum seekers and is planning to reduce welfare benefits to migrants who donât pass language tests and to ban girls under 10 from wearing head scarves. In Italy, Silvio Berlusconiâs Forza Italia finished this yearâs general election behind La Liga, whose leader, Matteo Salvini, is now the countryâs interior minister and the man responsible for Italyâs recent refusal to allow boats carrying desperate asylum seekers to dock in its ports. 
The fourth and last approach is the most radical of all. Rather than trying to isolate, borrow from or govern together with a populist radical-right insurgency, a center-right party actually turns itself into one. This is effectively what has happened in Hungary, where Viktor OrbÃ¡nâs Fidesz has over the past decade transmogrified from an apparently market-friendly mainstream party into an ultranationalist champion of closed borders and âilliberal democracy.â
Has it worked? Well, only up to a point. In Hungary, in spite of Mr. OrbÃ¡nâs efforts (or who knows, partly because it has shifted the systemâs center of gravity so far to the right) Jobbik, which is still very much a far-right party notwithstanding 
So, trying to beat a radical right-wing populist insurgency by becoming one â or for that matter, by adopting its agenda and even inviting it into government â turns out to be a foolâs errand. Just as important, it also has a huge ethical, as well as economic, cost. As the Bible puts it, âFor what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?â Thatâs a question that Europeâs center-right politicians (and maybe their Republican counterparts in the United States, too) seriously need to ask themselves, and soon.

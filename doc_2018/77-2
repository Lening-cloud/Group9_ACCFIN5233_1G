Investors might be tempted to take a trade skirmish in stride.
When President George W. Bush slapped high tariffs on steel imports 16 years ago, the stock market slipped a bit but recovered in the following days. Likewise, stocks may bounce back from the decline that followed the news on Thursday that President Trump will soon introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum.
In recent years, the global economic order appeared to be under threat a number of times. But stock markets rebounded from Britainâs vote to leave the European Union, Europeâs sovereign debt crisis, and the debt-ceiling clashes in the United States.
And there is a good chance that President Trumpâs tariffs wonât cause a great deal of collateral economic damage. They may end up being softer than Thursdayâs headlines suggest, as globalists push back. And like President Bushâs tariffs, President Trumpâs may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those, just as theyâve mostly shrugged off possible changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But vulnerabilities exist right now that could magnify any negative impact of President Trumpâs tariffs.
The stock market is still highly valued after a searing rally that took it to an all-time high in January. The Federal Reserve expects to increase interest rates multiple times this year. Compare that with March 2002, when President Bush introduced his trade restrictions: The Fed was cutting interest rates, a policy stance that can help support the economy and the stock market; stocks were nowhere near their peak of two years earlier; and President Bushâs administration was, overall, globalist in its outlook and didnât want to become isolated ahead of the Iraq war.
Importantly, the United States economy is less dominant than it was 16 years ago. Last year, the United States accounted for an estimated 24 percent of the worldâs gross domestic product, using data from the International Monetary Fund. In 2002, the share was 32 percent. If other countries retaliate, and tariffs broaden, the United Statesâ economy may be less resilient than some in the Trump administration may believe.
We asked yesterday if his familyâs real estate business was his biggest liability. Our colleaguesâ latest story shows 
â¢ Josh Harris of Apollo Global Management, an adviser on infrastructure issues, met with Mr. Kushner several times last year. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies, triple the size of the investment firmâs average property loan.
â¢ Citigroupâs C.E.O., Michael Corbat, met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million.
Mr. Kushner, his family business, Apollo and Citi all said that nothing improper had happened. But the meetings raise questions about how the Kushner Companies is weighing down the political fortunes of President Trumpâs son-in-law. Mr. Kushner has already had his interim security clearance downgraded amid a feud with the White House chief of staff, John Kelly.

â¢ Mr. Trump publicly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions as âDISGRACEFULâ for not ordering his own investigation into the handling of the Russia inquiry. (
President Trump said on Thursday that he will impose stiff and sweeping tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum as he moved to fulfill a key campaign promise to get tough on foreign competitors.
Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect âfor a long period of time.â The trade measures would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. It is unclear whether those would apply to all imports or be targeted toward specific countries, like China, which have been flooding the United States with cheap metals.
The announcement capped a frenetic and chaotic morning inside the White House as Mr. Trump summoned more than a dozen executives from the steel and aluminum industry to the White House, raising expectations that he would announce his long-promised tariffs. However, the legal review of the trade measure was not yet complete and, as of Thursday morning, White House advisers were still discussing various scenarios for tariff levels and which countries could be included, according to people familiar with the deliberations.
U.S. stock markets slipped around the time Mr. Trump made his comments about tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poorâs 500 industrial sector was down more than 2 percent, compared to the overall benchmark index which was down a bit less than 1 percent as of around 1:30 p.m. Automakers, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply. Another large consumer of those materials, aircraft maker Boeing also declined. As the countryâs largest exporter, Boeing would also likely be affected by rising global trade tensions if other nations responded to tariffs from the United States.
The comments also come on the same day as Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve, 
âThere are many approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but protectionism is a dead end. Trade restrictions address the symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they introduce other costs and distortions. While such measures might generate a temporary boost to growth from greater domestic production and consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other costs. Over time, such measures would retard productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.â

Jerome Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, 
âWe donât see any strong evidence yet of a decisive move up in wages. We see wages by a couple of measures trending up a little bit, but most of them continuing to grow at two and a half percent. Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.â

Just as the company isnât holding a traditional I.P.O., it isnât holding the usual kind of marketing road show either.

Spotify adds that it will hold additional âinvestor education meetings,â which would likely be reserved for the most important investors.

The hedge fund mogul finally called quits on his five-year campaign against the supplements company Herbalife, which he called a pyramid scheme and whose stock he once declared would go down to zero.
In the annals of Wall Street, investors have lost more on trades. But Mr. Ackmanâs bearish bet on Herbalife was a signature event given how much time, effort and money he devoted to making his case â all in the hopes that the federal authorities would take action against Herbalife.
Herbalifeâs shares closed yesterday at $92.10, a record high.

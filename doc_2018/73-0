Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin
The Republican tax cuts might not be rallying voters. But President Trump hopes another cut will do the trick: He said this weekend that he and Republican lawmakers have âa very major tax cutâ planned for middle-income people.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the NYT that the latest would be âspecifically focused on the middle class and not beyond that,â and that it would be released âshortly.â But the NYT notes that the timing 
There is no chance of such a plan passing even the House before the midterms, let alone the Senate, because Congress is in recess through the election. So the move appears to be an effort to give Republican voters a jolt of enthusiasm as the polls are opening â and perhaps an acknowledgment of how small a boost Mr. Trumpâs signature tax bill seems to be giving Republicans in the battle to control Congress.
Still unclear: how big the cuts would be or whether they would add to the federal deficit.
Chasisty Bee, who miscarried while working in a Verizon warehouse.
Refusing to accommodate pregnant women is often completely legal under federal law. But some women in strenuous jobs lost their pregnancies after employers denied their requests for light duty, according to 
Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Natalie Kitroeff have more on such working conditions:
Pregnancy discrimination is widespread in corporate America. Some employers deny expecting mothers promotions or pay raises; others fire them before they can take maternity leave. But for women who work in physically demanding jobs, pregnancy discrimination often can come with even higher stakes.
The New York Times reviewed thousands of pages of court and other public records involving workers who said they had suffered miscarriages, gone into premature labor or, in one case, had a stillborn baby after their employers rejected their pleas for assistance â a break from flipping heavy mattresses, lugging large boxes and pushing loaded carts.
Companies like the warehouse operator XPO Logistics and the grocery chain Albertsons have been sued over working conditions. (XPO and Albertsons have denied wrongdoing.)
The NYT adds that legislation to expand protections for expecting mothers has repeatedly stalled in Congress since 2012.
Richard Parsons
The company said that Richard Parsons, who took over after the broadcaster ousted Les Moonves, 
Mr. Parsons is known for his steady business hand â something CBS needs as it recovers from a fight with its controlling shareholder and a scandal over sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Moonves.
President Trump 
The S.&P. 500 is up 29.4 percent in the 710 days since Nov. 8, 2016. Over the same number of days after Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012, the benchmark posted a gain of 32.1 percent. The performance of stocks under Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama fall far short of the rally that took place after Bill Clinton was re-elected in 1996. The S.&P. 500 soared 48 percent over the equivalent period.
A growing budget deficit (exacerbated by Mr. Trumpâs tax cuts) and escalating trade tensions (spurred by his tariffs on Chinese goods) continue to weigh on investorsâ minds.
On Deck Capital, an online lender to small businesses, is teaming up with PNC Financial Services. On Deckâs pitch: Make loans to small businesses relatively quickly. It currently has $1 billion worth of loans on its balance sheet, but it can earn revenue by letting established banks use its underwriting technology. PNC, the eighth largest American bank, says using On Deck will cut costs, speed up lending and help find new customers. (JPMorgan Chase has worked with On Deck since 2016.)
PNCâs small business customers should be able to get a loan through On Deck within hours. âBy compressing weeks down to a couple of hours, and eventually minutes, you transform the way small business access capital,â Noah Breslow, On Deckâs chief executive, told Peter Eavis. (The service will also be open to businesses that arenât PNC clients.)

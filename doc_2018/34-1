The online auction platform contends that Amazon employees 
The e-commerce site said it was tipped off to the situation last month by an eBay seller who had been contacted by an Amazon representative. An early investigation by eBay found at least 50 Amazon representatives had sent hundreds of solicitation messages over the last several years.
Some messages appear to suggest the Amazon employees knew they were violating eBay’s terms of service. “EBay does scan for key terms and they don’t exactly like us poking around,” one message read. Other used terms like “a-m-a-z-o-n” or “A.M.Z.N.,” perhaps to evade detection.
EBay has issued a cease-and-desist letter, while Amazon says it is investigating the claims.
A start-up called Elemental Technologies makes powerful video-processing hardware. Its devices — which are assembled by a company called Super Micro Computer and used by organizations including the Defense Department and the C.I.A. — caught the eye of Amazon, which considered buying the company. But during due diligence, reports Bloomberg Businessweek, Amazon 
Nested on the servers’ motherboards, the testers found a tiny microchip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, that wasn’t part of the boards’ original design. Amazon reported the discovery to U.S. authorities, sending a shudder through the intelligence community.
Then:
During the ensuing top-secret probe, which remains open more than three years later, investigators determined that the chips allowed the attackers to create a stealth doorway into any network that included the altered machines. Multiple people familiar with the matter say investigators found that the chips had been inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China.
Toyota and Honda have both announced partnerships on autonomous vehicles — showing how difficult the technology is to develop, even for the world’s biggest automakers.

Driverless cars promise to redefine the multibillion-dollar auto industry, and the costs of bringing them to market are too big for almost any company to handle independently. “SoftBank alone and automakers alone can’t do everything,” Junichi Miyakawa, SoftBank’s chief technology officer, said.
The danger, as Anjani Trivedi of Bloomberg Opinion writes, is that the technology 
Senator Bernie Sanders 
The bill proposes breaking up financial institutions with exposure to more than 3 percent of America’s G.D.P. — equivalent to about $584 billion in assets. That covers:

They would have two years to sell assets. Then regulators would step in.
The bill is very unlikely to advance in the Senate. But it burnishes Mr. Sanders’s populist message for a probable 2020 presidential run.
When President Trump announced the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which replaces Nafta, he suggested that would be an end to tensions from the trade talks.
• Frank McKenna, a former Canadian ambassador to the U.S., said that “the president insulted our country, our prime minister and even our chief negotiator.”
• Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history at the University of Toronto, said, “There’s been disagreement, yes, but never public abuse like this.”
• Janice Stein, the founding director of the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, said Canada must now “invest more effort and resources in the rest of the G-7 — independent of what the United States says — in Germany and France and Japan.”

She’s only the latest in a run of celebrities to turn venture capitalist, as Erin Griffith of the NYT notes:
So far, deals from male actors, athletes and musical artists have garnered much more attention than those from famous women. Ashton Kutcher is a regular at tech conferences; Carmelo Anthony and Nas have their own funds; Leonardo DiCaprio has been an adviser to at least three venture firms.
Tyra Banks, Beyoncé and Demi Lovato have participated in start-up deals. But few women have built robust portfolios.

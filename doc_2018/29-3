Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower, brought Canada into a story thatâs drawn intense scrutiny to Facebook this week. And itâs not just because heâs from Victoria, British Columbia.
After focusing close attention on the social network with 
In his testimony, Mr. Wylie said that Aggregrate, a subsidiary of Cambridge Analyticaâs parent, drew on Cambridgeâs Facebook data to sway social media opinion in favor of the Leave side in the 2016 British referendum on the European Union vote, and he repeated claims that the Canadian company was used to avoid British campaign spending limits. (The company has denied the claims.)
Attention inevitably turned to Mr. Wylieâs activities in Canada. When he was 19, Mr. Wylie worked briefly in the office of Michael Ignatieff, then the Liberal leader. Then early in 2016, when Mr. Trumpâs victory was not being widely predicted, Mr. Wylie, through a company called Eunoia Technologies, was given a 100,000 Canadian dollar contract by the Liberal Caucus Research Bureau. Like all of the political partiesâ research shops, the bureau is separate from the partyâs other operations and is funded by Parliament.
Melissa Cotton, the bureauâs managing director, said in a statement that Mr. Wylie did not have access to the partyâs data and that he worked on projects that appeared to have involved monitoring social media, identifying issues and analyzing how Liberal members communicate with voters.
âPreliminary work was done by Eunoia Technologies but after seeing what was offered, Liberal Caucus Research Bureau decided not to move forward.â Ms. Cotton said, without explaining why it cut ties.
Mr. Wylieâs time in Ottawa, however, brought to light something that most people have overlooked. Unlike businesses and the federal government itself, federal political parties arenât subject to Canadaâs internet privacy and data protection laws.
Some of those laws date to the 1980s and the 
The political party exemption came about in part because of a parliamentary tradition of not giving bureaucrats or outside bodies control over a partyâs affairs. I called 
âEvery other sector is covered by privacy laws but political parties,â he said. âThey are all using data so I donât think there is a good argument about why they should be under privacy rules.â
As for concerns about encroaching on Parliament, Professor Pal isnât buying that either. He noted that parties were already âheavily regulatedâ through Elections Canada and election fund-raising laws.
So whatâs a Facebook user to do now? My colleague Brian X. Chen, who writes about consumer technology, has 
âWhat, if anything, can they do to protect their data connected to the social network?
Hereâs the harsh truth: Not much, short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account.â
What about deleting old Facebook and Twitter posts? 
That, of course, leaves the option of quitting social media. And thatâs what Iâm interested in hearing about from you. Have the last couple of weeks turned your mind toward leaving Facebook or other social media sites? If youâre inclined, do you think itâs possible to leave? And if you leave, what will you lose and what will you gain? Please send your thoughts to

Other injustices and misfortune followed the five through their lives. The decision by the City of North Bay to turn over the log house to a village without the obvious means to maintain or restore it looked like the latest one.
But much has changed in the past year. After a public campaign, North Bay reversed its decision, and the house has been moved to downtown where it will become a museum.

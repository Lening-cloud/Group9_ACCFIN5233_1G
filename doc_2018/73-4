The social network reported slowing revenue growth in its quarterly earnings yesterday — and said that would probably be the new normal.
Facebook also sketched out what its new business plan would look like, months after conceding it needed to change after numerous privacy and disinformation scandals. The company will focus less on its News Feed and more on ephemeral messaging, private chats and video. 
Facebook does not charge as much for advertisers to run ads on “Stories” as it does in the News Feed, so shifting to ephemeral messaging may not be as lucrative, the company said. That is partly because tools to make ads for “Stories” are not fully developed yet, and it is easy for users to ignore ads on the service or skip the service altogether, analysts said.
The company will also continue to invest in solving problems relating to issues such as misinformation and user privacy.
Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that the move would hurt financial growth. “We have great products people love, but it will take us some time to catch up,” he said. “Our revenue growth will be slower.”
Investors might be spooked. “This is no longer the muscular Facebook that could do little wrong financially,”

The shipping company said yesterday that it had shut down a discount program for members of the National Rifle Association. FedEx said it wasn’t a response to the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, but because the partnership didn’t bring in enough business.

The company had faced pressure from gun-control activists to end the program, in particular after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in February. At the time, companies including Delta, United Airlines, MetLife and several car-rental outlets dropped deals with the N.R.A.
But FedEx had refused to do so. In February, the company said that while it opposed civilian ownership of assault rifles, it “does not and will not deny service or discriminate against any legal entity regardless of their policy positions or political views.”
A single number could unsettle China’s economy in the coming weeks. If Beijing lets the renminbi’s value weaken past 7 to the dollar, it could intensify a trade battle with the U.S. — bringing benefits, but the risk of damage, too.
For now, the country is trying to prop up the currency. It sees 7 to the dollar as a big psychological barrier, and Beijing has

Not part of the agreement: the U.S., as President Trump withdrew from negotiations nearly two years ago, saying that TPP would be a bad deal for America. While he has floated the idea of rejoining, that seems unlikely: Mr. Trump said he wants substantially more-favorable terms, which would be difficult to negotiate.

Leslie Moonves, the head of CBS, is among the most-lauded media chiefs of the past decade. CBSâs stock has nearly doubled since 
But now 
Chief executives with Mr. Moonvesâs record donât often find themselves in this position, but he is there because of CBS and Viacomâs unique corporate governance structure: namely, the super-voting powers of the Redstone familyâs vehicle, National Amusements.
Letâs recap the kind of power that National Amusements has over the corporate siblings, thanks to its dual classes of stock:
â¢ Despite owning just over 10 percent of the outstanding shares at CBS and just under 10 percent at Viacom, the Redstones have about 80 percent of the voting power at both companies.
â¢ With that kind of power, National Amusements could replace the board at either company at any point in time.
It is that power that allows Shari Redstone to compel CBS and Viacom to explore a merger for the second time.
At the moment, CBS and Viacom are at loggerheads over both the price of a deal â the two proposals 
A person briefed on Ms. Redstoneâs thinking, who was not authorized to speak publicly about private negotiations, told DealBook that Ms. Redstone isnât preparing to oust Mr. Moonves, at least at the moment. And 
CBS said in a statement Wednesday: âThe industry and the marketplace know Leslie Moonvesâ record and we think it speaks for itself.â Viacom declined to comment.
Thanks to the dual-class stock structure â something CBS and Viacom share with the likes of Facebook, Alphabet and The New York Times Company â thereâs little that regular shareholders, or management of either company, can do.
Legal experts say that National Amusements has fiduciary duties to shareholders of each company, but that the Redstones unquestionably have the power to replace board members.
âYou can stack the board,â said John Coffee of Columbia Law School, though he added that âit might be poor form to stuff the boardâ before pushing through a merger or C.E.O. change.
Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that companies controlled by a dual-class structure can sometimes opt for other shareholders to have a voice. But that isnât a requirement.
Professor Elson said that Ms. Redstone has the ability to force through a deal or a board change. But, he added, âthat doesnât mean that these things go without litigation.â
Tax cuts, bank deregulation and a recovering global economy were expected to unleash a surge of bank lending that could stoke an even stronger expansion. But lending in the first quarter is set to disappoint, at least going by the results of the four big banks that reported Friday.
JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial had a combined $2.78 trillion of loans at the end of the first quarter, up 3 percent from $2.7 billion at the end of the same period a year ago. How does that growth rate stack up? Itâs more or less in line with the 2.9 percent increase in loans the banks notched up last year, but it is well below the 4.6 percent and the 4.4 percent rates that they together achieved in 2016 and 2015.
Each quarter, much attention is paid to the performance of the big banksâ Wall Street operations. But activities like trading are only remotely related to the real economy. As a result, to assess whether banks are assisting the wider economy, it makes more sense to look at trends in their lending, which directly finances consumer spending, home purchases and corporate investments.
Investors may have been disappointed at the first-quarter lending numbers. Despite the four banksâ strong profits, their stock prices on Friday slid.
The unexceptional first-quarter loan growth may, of course, give way to bigger increases later this year as confidence builds. And beneath the aggregated loan totals are some numbers that suggest things could improve. Citigroupâs loans grew 7.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with the year-ago period. The increase was driven by a 13 percent surge in corporate lending, much of which took place in Europe and Asia. And the first-quarter total for the four banks was held back by a 1.1 percent decline at Wells Fargo, which is operating under a strict regulatory edict.
Still, the obstacles to a bigger expansion are clear. Interest rates are going up, making the cost of borrowing higher. Why, for instance, would large companies take on more debt, at a higher cost, when there is a good chance that the current trade tensions could dampen global growth? And individuals may be reluctant to take on mortgage debt when wage growth is tepid, and higher house prices have left them paying out an

Shares of the biggest banks are faring worse than the broader stock indexes.
The KBW Bank Index, made up of 24 of the largest banks, is off nearly 1 percent while the S.&P. 500 is essentially flat in early trading.
JPMorgan was down 1.1 percent, Citigroup was off 1.5 percent, and Wells Fargo fell 2.3 percent.
The declines come despite JPMorgan announcing record profits and Citi reporting its highest earnings since 2015.
The slide in bank stocks is âa sign that many of the upbeat earnings numbers have already been priced into share prices,â 
Following widespread missteps at the bank, the Fed in February told Wells Fargo that, until sufficient improvements were made, it could not increase the amount of assets it holds. Some analysts said the cap need not stop the bank from making more loans, because it could sell securities and then use that money to do more lending. But loans did not grow in the first quarter. At the end of March, Wells Fargo had $947 billion of loans, down from $958 billion a year earlier, and also down from $957 billion at the end of 2017.
But the decline is not large, and itâs not clear how much the Fedâs cap is to blame. Wells Fargoâs loans had not been growing strongly in recent quarters.

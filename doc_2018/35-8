Leisurely and deliberate, intelligent and casually cruel, âHave a Nice Dayâ is a stone-cold gangster thriller whose violence unfolds in passionless bursts.

The stolen bag of moola moves briskly from one grasping hand to another, yet the movieâs images are often strangely static. For seconds at a time, the only movement in the frame might come from a single, flashing light on empty train tracks or a blinking neon sign in front of a deserted factory.

Yesterday can be summed up in one word: 
The S.&P. 500 ended the day down 0.55 percent, after a fall of more than 2 percent. Losses in Asia and Europe foreshadowed the drop, then a poor earnings report from 3M and gloomy forecasts from Caterpillar caused the markets to tumble early. A drop in oil prices drove further losses.
The apparent recovery came as a surprise to many. One investor 
This all takes place against a backdrop of other concerns for investors: global economic problems (highlighted yesterday by Italy’s budget fight — more on that below); America’s trade war with China, which is 
On that final point, President Trump 
For now, the volatility has spurred investors to put money into less risky assets like government bonds. They may park their capital there for some time, so long as the strong economy and lackluster earnings reports make it hard to figure out where the markets are headed.
Saudi Arabia kicked off its Future Investment Initiative conference yesterday with boasts of business deals. But the event, which many C.E.O.s ditched amid the controversy over Jamal Khashoggi’s death, was

The Apple C.E.O. spoke at a data protection conference in Europe today, and criticized tech giants for taking advantage of users’ data. “These stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,” 
He cited what he called a data industrial complex “that’s being weaponized against us with military efficiency.” He didn’t mention Facebook or Google by name, but argued that rogue actors and even governments 
The speech aligns Apple with the E.U. approach to data privacy — and against rivals whose businesses are built on collecting, and profiting from, user data.
The European Union 
Italy’s leaders compared their plan to the American New Deal, and said it would lift the country out of its economic doldrums. Instead of complying with E.U. demands to revise the budget, they now appear to relish the fight with Brussels for political gain.
Ultimately, it may be the markets that stop the Italian government. The spread between Italian government bonds and their German equivalent

The revelation that the lender’s Estonia branch handled billions in illegal money sent shock waves through the European banking sector. The WSJ 
Here’s how Mr. Wilkinson first became suspicious of a client called Lantana Trade LLP, which moved $480 million through the Estonian office in five months:
When Mr. Wilkinson downloaded the business’s records, what he saw made no sense. “Net Assets,” said a filing it made to Companies House, the British registrar that collects company data: “0.00.”
A simple clerical error, Mr. Wilkinson said a bank compliance officer reassured him weeks later, adding that Danske had asked Lantana to submit a new, correct version to Companies House. He forgot about it.
A year later, in September 2013, a senior bank official said Lantana was no longer a client, Mr. Wilkinson said. He added that another official told him that one of Lantana’s owners was a relative of Vladimir Putin, which was denied by a spokesman for the Russian president.

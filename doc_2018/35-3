For more than a year, Facebook has faced a torrent of scandals over misinformation and data privacy, drawing a global backlash for its handling of the issues. A 
Here are some of the biggest takeaways from the investigation.
“In the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss [Alex Stamos, then the company’s security chief]. Mr. Stamos’s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. “
“Mr. Stamos’s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of [Sheryl] Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal. ‘You threw us under the bus!’ she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.”
“ ‘We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,’ Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.”
“Facebook also expanded its work with [the P.R. firm] Definers. On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called [Apple’s C.E.O. Tim] Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users.”
After Mr. Cook publicly derided Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg was so furious that he later ordered his management team to use only Android phones — arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple’s.
“As evidence accumulated that Facebook’s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view.”
The NYT story has already prompted speculation about how the company will react to it. Recode asks: “

“I’m very happy about the state of the economy now,” Mr. Powell said. “There’s pretty good reason to think we’re going to continue in a positive vein like that.”
He added that the Fed deserved credit for its role in the long and steady expansion. “Our policy is part of the reason the economy is in such a good place now,” he said.
Mr. Powell also noted that Congress — not the White House — oversees the Fed, and added that the central bank would continue to raise rates for now.
China, Germany and Japan have all seen their economies struggle in recent months. America’s has not, and it looks set to avoid that — but there’s still reason to worry.

The story of Walmartâs $16 billion deal for Flipkart began nearly two years ago and spanned secret negotiations in both Bentonville, Ark., and Bangalore, India. Hereâs an account of how it came together based on interviews by people involved in the transaction, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal.
Driving the deal was the retail giantâs push to bolster its presences in e-commerce and emerging markets like India. In recent years, Walmart had bought 
Walmart had initially approached Flipkart in 2016. But it quickly backed away to focus on its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, one of these people said.
By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business.
Walmart could also provide a permanent base of capital, which would allow Flipkart to avoid raising money every few years. For its part, Walmart would feel more comfortable if it had majority control, even as it was prepared to give Flipkartâs management some degree of independence.
In December, Amazon entered the fray, these people said. The e-commerce titan sought to buy Flipkart outright. But Flipkart was wary. It worried regulators would block a deal that would have combined Indiaâs two biggest e-commerce services.
Discussions with Walmart pressed forward. Over the next few months, the boards of Walmart and Flipkart refined what became Wednesdayâs deal: The size of the stake Walmart would buy and at what price. They also settled on which of Flipkartâs investors would sell. Some, including the investment firm Tiger Global Management and the Chinese internet giant Tencent, wanted to stay on board, betting that Flipkart would continue to grow. Others, including the nearly $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund, were happy to cash out.

â¢ Walmart will buy an initial stake of 77 percent in Flipkart and invest $2 billion in fresh capital into the Indian firm.
â¢ The two companies said they are in continuing talks with other investors to purchase a stake, which might reduce Walmartâs eventual shareholding in Flipkart.
â¢ Walmart said the purchase would reduce its net income by at least $750 million this year and by more than double that amount next year.

â¢ Although Indiaâs population is rapidly coming online, the number of people with enough income to shop online is still tiny.
â¢ Walmart is paying a hefty premium to buy its way into the pole position in Indiaâs e-commerce market, but it has not yet outlined any strategy that would keep it ahead of Amazon there.

Criticâs Corner
âAfter buying Jet.com for $3 billion a couple years ago, Walmartâs efforts to compete online in the United States have hit some bumps. Earlier misadventures in China prompted it to join forces with local rival JD.com in return for a small stake. India will test the U.S. companyâs ability to keep pace halfway around the world with Amazon, whose investors are as patient as boss Jeff Bezos. This will be a make-or-break overseas deal for Walmart.â

Brexit is creating uncertainty for British universities that is acutely felt by our European students and staff members. But our global vision remains clear.
Imperial College London and other British universities are assertively campaigning in Westminster and Brussels for policies that support talent mobility and access to European research programs.
Over the last decade, Imperial scholars collaborated on more than 60,000 research papers with European peers. We want that figure to grow. That is why we started a seed fund after the Brexit vote, independent of government. It is supporting scores of Imperial academicsâ European collaborations in fields like data privacy, particle physics and cancer prevention.
We have started similar seed funds with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and with Tsinghua University in Beijing as our global ambitions grow. Imperial recently opened an international mathematics laboratory in London with CNRS, Franceâs research agency. It cements the status of our two countries as global leaders in mathematics, artificial intelligence and aligned disciplines.
The labâs researchers will enjoy equal access to European funding and collaborations, even after Brexit. Such partnerships should become more, not less, frequent.
As an American academic in London, I was disappointed by the Brexit vote. Yet British universitiesâ commitment to their core values of internationalism and excellence gives us reason to be confident in their future.

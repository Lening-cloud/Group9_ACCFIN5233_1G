â¢ âThe Justice Department is investigating Ms. Mengâs company, Huawei, on charges of violating sanctions on Iran, and her arrest was meant as a warning shot by the Trump administration in its campaign to limit the global spread of Chinese technology.â
â¢ âWhile the Justice Department did brief the White House about the impending arrest, Mr. Trump was not told about it. And the subject did not come up at the dinner with Mr. Xi.â
â¢ âFormer American officials said the awkward timing of it was most likely a coincidence that grew out of the unpredictable travel schedule of Ms. Meng.â

President Trump got some good news yesterday: The U.S. exported more oil and fuel than it imported last week. That was the first time that had happened in 75 years. But that may have been outweighed by the monthly U.S. trade deficit hitting $55.5 billion in October, the highest monthly level in 10 years.

OPEC ended a meeting yesterday without striking a deal to reduce oil output, 
Officials discussed a range of cuts, with a reduction of a million barrels per day â or around 1 percent of global oil supply, a modest amount in the eyes of traders â thought to be enough to stabilize prices. The indecision reflects the different pressures facing the oil industry:
â¢ On one hand, the world is widely viewed as having an oil glut substantial enough to justify a cut in production, a move that would prop up prices.
â¢ But President Trump is pressing OPEC, and Saudi Arabia in particular, to maintain production levels to keep prices down for American consumers.
Oil prices tumbled amid the failure to strike a deal. Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropped about 3.5 percent, to $59.40.
There was little sign that things would improve when officials reconvene today. Saudi Arabiaâs energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, told reporters he was ânot confidentâ that an agreement that would keep supply and demand in balance was within reach.

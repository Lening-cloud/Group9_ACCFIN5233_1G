On Wall Street, thereâs been a running parlor game about whether Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chaseâs chief executive, would try to run for president in 2020. His annual letters, filled with commentary on U.S. policy, have only increased the chatter, and this yearâs letter, released Thursday, is no different. It touches on everything from trade to immigration. While Mr. Dimon, who once called himself âbarely a Democrat,â says he plans to stay at the bank for the next five years, the question among political prognosticators is whether Mr. Dimonâs policy views could ever find a home among voters in this politically polarized environment.
Mr. Dimonâs sensible letter was seemingly supportive of some of President Trumpâs policies, while taking the opposing side on others. Mr. Dimon particularly applauded the corporate tax cut and deregulation efforts. On China trade, Mr. Dimon writes: âIt is not unreasonable for the United States to press ahead for more equivalency,â and that âone of the administrationâs best arguments is that negotiation alone has not worked.â However, he said he would like to see more cooperation with U.S. allies on talks with China and added that the U.S. should ârevisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership.â
On immigration, he called for tougher border control, writing, âAmerican citizens have the right to complain that we have not successfully protected our borders since the last immigration reform in 1986.â He also said, âPeople immigrating to this country should be taught American history, our language and our principles.â At the same time, he also advocated for âa path to legal status and citizenshipâ for âDreamersâ and improving âmerit-based immigrationâ programs so that immigrants educated here can stay.
Mr. Dimon made a point of saying that part of the problems facing the country is that too many people are talking past each other.
âWhen people argue as if there are binary solutions, the argument is almost always wrong,â he wrote, advocating that people try to look at all sides of a situation. âI tell my liberal friends to read columnists like Arthur Brooks and George Will. And I tell my conservative friends to read writers like Tom Friedman.â
If Mr. Dimon were to run, he would likely have to do so as an independent. It is hard to see how liberal Democrats would embrace much of his deregulatory positions. And yet many of his positions â and especially some of his social positions not enunciated in his letter â may not be far right enough to capture the interest of Republicans.
Maybe the country needs someone in the middle, but history has not been kind to third-party candidates.
Jamie Dimon, in his annual 
But he also addressed a policy area much closer to home â bank regulation. Mr. Dimon often has expressed skepticism about aspects of the banking overhaul that took place in the wake of the financial crisis. But his remarks on regulation arguably carry more weight now. Congress is closer to modifying the post-crisis rules than at any point since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010. An important regulatory requirement Mr. Dimon criticized, therefore, might become a focus for those wanting to roll back the rules.
Mr. Dimon in this yearâs letter zeroed in on regulations that require banks to have a certain amount of liquidity, the financial term for access to cash or low-risk assets that can be easily sold for cash.
In 2008, some large financial firms were crippled when customers, depositors and creditors withdrew their money. The Federal Reserve and taxpayers had to step in to support the banks. To help prevent a repeat of this, post-crisis rules require that banks hold a certain amount of liquid assets to cover a theoretical level of outflows. Mr. Dimon is in favor of banks having more liquidity than before the crisis, but in the letter, released Thursday, he wrote:
Liquidity requirements, while much higher, now have an element of rigidity built in that did not exist before. Banks will be unable to use that liquidity when they most need to do so â to make loans or intermediate markets. They have a âred lineâ they cannot cross (they are required to maintain hard and fast liquidity requirements). As clients demand more liquidity from their banks, the banks essentially will be unable to provide it.
Notably, 
First, a bank that lacks liquidity is in no position to lend. When a bankâs creditors and customers fear it doesnât have enough cash in reserve, they will most likely withdraw their money. This not only deprives the bank of the money it needs to lend, it also sharply reduces its chance of survival. Or as Gregg Gelzinis of the left-leaning Center for American Progress puts it, âYou wonât be able to take this action if you fail.â
Perhaps more importantly, Mr. Dimon leaves out some crucial context. Congress designed the whole post-crisis overhaul to ensure that banks have the funds on hand to lend during a downturn. Dodd-Frankâs architects saw that when banks stop lending, it makes a recession far worse. And that is one reason why banks now have much higher levels of capital. Regulators expect that they will use up some of that capital to keep lending through the economic tumult. This is why the Federal Reserve 
The nationâs largest bank holding companies have strong capital levels and retain their ability to lend to households and businesses during a severe recession.
Andrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, followed up with more material on Mr. Dimonâs thinking on liquidity.
He re-emphasized Mr. Dimonâs point about having to tie up funds that could be used to make loans. Mr. Gray noted that a bank facing outflows would be expected to keep refilling its pool of liquid assets to be in compliance with a liquidity regulation. This would leave fewer funds for lending and making markets, Mr. Gray asserted.
He also addressed the argument that higher capital levels, not liquidity, will largely determine the extent to which banks will lend through a downturn. Mr. Gray asserted that liquidity rules play an important role in ensuring banks have the resources to participate in wider financial markets. Rules forcing the hoarding of liquidity may, thus, crimp that activity.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has complained that the regulator engages in âwasteful spending.â He even submitted a quarterly budget request recently of $0.
That attitude apparently didnât apply to two of his recent hires.

The consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street.
As a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat. Of the agencyâs 1,600 employees, 219 make more than $200,000, according to the records reviewed by The Times.
BlackRock, the worldâs largest money manager, plans to offer a series of new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of firearms.
They include:
â¢ a new exchange-traded fund that will track the performance of the MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, composed of small stocks with favorable environmental, social and governance standards, while specifically excluding producers and large retailers of civilian firearms.
â¢ a similar credit-focused ETF that eschews the debt of gunmakers and distributors.
â¢ an option to take the guns out of institutional strategies tracking major market indexes, including the S&P 500, the Russell 2000 and three others.
âBlackRockâs moves may spark criticism from gun-rights supporters, who lashed out at companies like Delta Air Lines that severed ties with the National Rifle Association. But itâs hard to see how offering customers more choice is ever a bad idea. Moreover, by getting out early, BlackRock makes clear to those young people lobbying for tighter gun laws â who it hopes will be customers for decades to come â that it has something for them. Far from virtue signaling, itâs simply good business.â

Of all the companies the two could have started together, theyâve chosen an unusual approach: a hydroponic farming start-up focused on creating more healthful food.
Their new business, Sensei, formally unveiled itself Monday afternoon, wading into an industry that has become increasingly popular among investors.

Sensei is focused more on wellness. While the company ultimately plans to expand into an array of businesses, its initial focus is on hydroponic farming, using software and sensors to monitor growing conditions. (Its first farm is on Lanai, the Hawaiian island of which Mr. Ellison 
Senseiâs first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre.
âSo far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot. But scale is just part of the equation,â Dr. Agus said in a statement. âTo properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.â
Its first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.
But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.
âFor so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,â Daniel Gruneberg, Senseiâs president, said in a statement. âNow, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.â
Facebookâs stock had its worst day in about four years.
Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.
The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the worldâs largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industryâs profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.
Facebookâs stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.
âWe think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,â 
Facebookâs woes showed signs of spreading, too.
The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the indexâs 11 sectors.
Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.
In all, Mondayâs slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.
Fund flows added fuel to the selloff.

Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 336 points, or 1.35 percent, while the S.&P. 500, was off nearly 39 points, or 1.42 percent.
Is Mark Zuckerbergâs unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?
The giant social media company is 
Mr. Zuckerberg at first 
These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.
Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the companyâs guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebookâs profitability. Indeed, thereâs a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerbergâs protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.
In the near term, though, itâs hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebookâs extraordinary profitability â its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue â will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.
If governments propose restrictions on using membersâ data, Facebookâs business model would be tested. The companyâs board, in theory, should press Mr. Zuckerberg for details on how he will deal with such shackles. But prominent board members like
Lawmakers may hold the line, however, sensing that the public has real concerns about the company. And if Facebookâs responses look tardy and inadequate, the consequences could be harsh, as the fate of Wells Fargo

Facebook argued that the incident wasnât a data breach and that Cambridge had committed a violation. But former Federal Trade Commission officials told the WaPo that Facebook 
âFacebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didnât influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.â
A woman in Tempe, Ariz., 
The Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel when it struck the woman, who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk, the Tempe police said in a statement. The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p.m. The woman was not publicly identified.
Uber said it had suspended testing of its self-driving cars in Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.
âOur hearts go out to the victimâs family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,â an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement.
The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driverâs seat. This month, California said that, in April, it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel.
Justin Dearborn, the companyâs chief executive, will replace Mr. Ferro as chairman.
âI am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation,â Mr. Ferro said in a statement.
Mr. Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc. But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny.
The Long-Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long-term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality.
The start-up disclosed today that its partner, the IEX stock exchange, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX.
The filing â which will commence the public part of the S.E.C.âs review of the rule changes at IEX â advances 
If the S.E.C approves the rules, it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles, but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq like any other listing. That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSEâs founder, Eric Ries.

â¢ Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks, to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering.
â¢ Mr. Ries has spoken of the need to reward long-term investors. âMost of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long-term shareholders,â he told me. âThat frees up management to do whatâs right.â
â¢ It comes as companies continue to bemoan short-term thinking in the stock markets that has C.E.O.s focused more on meeting a quarterâs targets than longer-term goals.
â¢ LTSEâs goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares. But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles.
â¢ LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors.
Itâs a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public.
âWhat we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,â Mr. Ries said.

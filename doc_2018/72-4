• His father’s housing empire started paying Mr. Trump during childhood — the equivalent of $200,000 a year in today’s money when he was three.
• Mr. Trump has often said that his father lent him only $1 million. He received at least $60.7 million in loans, many never repaid.
• Fred Trump grossly undervalued properties that he passed onto his children, dodging hundreds of millions in gift taxes.
• The Trumps created a company that inflated the value of equipment purchased for their housing units and passed the difference onto the Trump children. One tax expert said that might have constituted criminal tax fraud.
The statute of limitations has passed for potential criminal charges, but the Trump family could face civil fines. New York State’s tax regulator said it has

Amazon has taken fire from all political corners, including President Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren, over issues from worker conditions to anti-competitive practices. This policy, which affects 250,000 employees and 100,000 seasonal workers, buys it some political good will: Senator Bernie Sanders praised it as a “

Its Model 3 output nearly doubled, into the 50,000-to-55,000 range that Mr. Musk had predicted. The carmaker delivered 83,500 vehicles to customers, 55,840 of which were Model 3s, about three times as many as in the second quarter.
That’s big: The mass-market Model 3 is crucial for Tesla’s future. But as Neal Boudette of the NYT writes, the company 
In previous quarters, the company’s costs increased as it made more cars, wiping out any chance at getting into the black. Tesla is expected to report its third-quarter earnings later this month. David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, said that Tesla could report a profit for the quarter but that he was not convinced that it would. “They’re making more cars,” he said, “but it’s hard to say if they are making money on every one.”
Still, it’s doing much better than the rest of the American auto market, which had a bad September, with 
Facebook Connect, which lets users log into other apps with their Facebook accounts, was supposed to be a digital passport to the rest of the internet. Now it could be a big headache.
The company on Friday said that account entry keys for at least 50 million Facebook users had been stolen. But Mike Isaac and Kate Conger of the NYT explain how Facebook Connect could 
Those stolen credentials could have been used to gain access to so many other sites. Companies that allow customers to log in with Facebook Connect are scrambling to figure out whether their own user accounts have been compromised. The hack and its fallout underscore the lengths to which Facebook has cemented itself as the identity of the internet, and what happens when the security systems of one company — trusted by so many — fail.
Facebook says there is currently “
The American economy is enjoying an unusual but sustainable period of low unemployment and low inflation, according to the Fed chairman — and it could continue.
Economists usually have interpreted low unemployment as a warning of higher inflation. Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT explains why Mr. Powell is 
He said the Fed’s success in holding down inflation in recent decades has reinforced public expectations that inflation would stay low, and that, in turn, is helping to keep inflation low. “These developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation,” Mr. Powell said on Tuesday in Boston at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics.
Coinbase, the world’s biggest marketplace for trading cryptocurrencies, is close to finalizing 
It may mean that major investors believe in crypto, despite the industry’s challenges. (Bitcoin is trading at about $6,478, 67 percent below its December 2017 peak, and other digital currencies are trading at lows as well.)
Coinbase has suffered from that plunge, according to Recode. But its executives argue that the company remains a technology platform that can ride out the waxing and waning of crypto prices. Unless this all turns out to be a bubble.

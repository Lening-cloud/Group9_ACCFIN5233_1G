But the size of these companies makes their fall everyoneâs problem, as Mr. Phillips notes:
The sheer bulk of the technology companies gives them outsize influence over the market â in both directions. The tumult in tech on Monday pushed major stock market indexes into negative territory for November, leaving investors clinging to a gain of less than 1 percent for the year.
Futures markets tracking U.S. stocks suggest that the slide could continue today.
Though the British prime ministerâs political allies donât seem keen on her plan for departing the E.U., she may have the backing of the countryâs businesses. She received a warm reception yesterday at the Confederation of British Industry, a trade group, from corporate leaders who were

The developments could bring about a swift fall for Mr. Ghosn, who made his name by rescuing Nissan from dire financial straits almost two decades ago and forging partnerships with Renault and Mitsubishi to create an international car giant.
Shares in Nissan and Renault, where Mr. Ghosn is chairman and C.E.O., are down by about 10 percent in European trading.
Last week, it looked like trade tensions might finally ease between Beijing and Washington. But Vice President Mike Pence and President Xi Jinping of China both 
The NYT notes that failure to make any progress during the talks left world leaders increasingly exasperated. âThe entire world is worried,â said Prime Minister Peter OâNeill of Papua New Guinea, who led the talks.
The event suggests that no truce between China and the U.S. is imminent. And it sets up a high-stakes showdown at the Group of 20 conference in Argentina this month, which Mr. Xi and President Trump are expected to attend.

A big part of that now appears focused on bolstering employee morale, which reports have suggested is falling. During his Q. and A., Mr. Zuckerberg said that leaks to reporters were often caused by âissues with morale.â Staff members were encouraged to keep working on the companyâs problems despite media scrutiny.
The British prime minister still faces daunting odds: Getting her proposal for Britainâs departure from the E.U. through Parliament will be tough. Sheâs now betting that British companies will convince skeptical lawmakers to back a deal they dislike.
Mrs. May is scheduled to meet with the Confederation of British Industry, a trade group, today. She hopes to collect

The businessman said yesterday that he would give $1.8 billion to his alma mater to make the school âforever need-blind.â Itâs believed to be the single biggest private donation to higher education in modern times.
The donation is meant to let Johns Hopkins offer more financial aid to students in the form of scholarship grants instead of loans. âOur dedicated financial aid endowment was simply too small,â the schoolâs president, Ronald Daniels,

A recent analysis by The Times found that at dozens of Americaâs elite colleges, more students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire bottom 60 percent of that scale â even though many of those lower-income students have the qualifications to get in.
And until recently, by some estimates, half of all high-achieving low- and middle-income students have not even been applying to top colleges â largely because they believe they canât afford it, doubt theyâll be accepted, or arenât even aware of their options.

âGenerally speaking, I am not a big fan of regulation. Iâm a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free market is not working. And it hasnât worked here. I think itâs inevitable that there will be some level of regulation. I think the Congress and the administration at some point will pass something.â
The comment is another effort by Mr. Cook to distance Apple, which focuses on selling hardware, from companies like Facebook and Google that make money from selling ads based on user data.
He also argued that tech companies should embrace regulation. âThis is not a matter of privacy versus profits, or privacy versus technical innovation,â he said. âThatâs a false choice.â
In the years after Maoâs death, China had to recover from decades of political and economic turmoil. More than three-quarters of the population lived in extreme poverty.
Today, China leads the world in its number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and â by some counts â billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent of the population. An isolated, impoverished country has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.
To explain that drastic shift, the NYT has put together

âIâve never really told this story. Even though itâs on ESPN and I play basketball, this is a business story and not a sports story,â Mr. James said in a statement to DealBook. âMy guys and I have been scrapping, building and fighting for 16 years to create an entirely new model. I hope this documentary connects with every young, aspiring entrepreneur trying to change the game and refuse to accept the old way doing of things.â

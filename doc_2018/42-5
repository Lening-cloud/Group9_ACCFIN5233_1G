Tensions between Silicon Valley and the government aren’t limited to misinformation — they stretch from data privacy issues, in the wake of Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal, to the A.I. work by Google, Microsoft and Amazon for various agencies. Some companies have pulled out of high-profile projects because of concerns from employees.
Yet Andrew argues that Silicon Valley 
“I worry that it will stall progress,” he said. “Innovation has been fueled for decades by private-public partnerships. It smacks of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Even if you’re not a fan of the president, you can still serve your country.”
Silicon Valley employees set off a quiet — but growing — debate across corporate America in the age of Trump: What does it mean to be a patriotic company when you vehemently disagree with your nation’s leader? 
The sports clothing giant has made Mr. Kaepernick, the quarterback N.F.L. teams have shunned for his protests during the national anthem,

We’ve been here before, most notably with the F.B.I.’s request that Apple break into the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter. Big tech companies make much of protecting user data. Government backdoors undermine their promises — and could end up opening for hackers, too.

The intense reactions to Mr. Liu’s legal troubles reflect the public’s fascination with China’s self-made tech tycoons, who have become symbols of the country’s rise as a global power and its upward social mobility. Their books are best sellers. Their private lives are tabloid fodder. Their speeches on success and entrepreneurship are perpetually running on TV screens at airports.
JD.com, meanwhile, was already facing headwinds: increasingly fierce competition from Alibaba, slowing Chinese economic growth. It could do without further headaches.

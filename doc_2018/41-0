PARIS â Too little, too late: That was the reaction of the so-called Yellow Vest protesters to the 
Those deeper demands, the governmentâs inability to keep up, and fierce resentment of prosperous and successful cities run like an electrified wire connecting 
What ties these uprisings together, beyond the demands, is a rejection of existing parties, unions and government institutions that are seen as incapable of channeling the depth of their grievances or of offering a bulwark against economic insecurity.
But what makes Franceâs revolt different is that it has not followed the usual populist playbook. It is not tethered to a political party, let alone to a right-wing one. It is not focusing on race or migration, and those issues do not appear on the Yellow Vestsâ list of complaints. It is not led by a single fire-breathing leader. Nationalism is not on the agenda.
The uprising is instead mostly organic, spontaneous and self-determined. It is mostly about economic class. It is about the inability to pay the bills.
In that regard, it is more 
In Paris, it was the luxury shopping streets, the Avenue Kleber and the Rue de Rivoli â insolent symbols of urban privilege compared with the drab provinces from which the Yellow Vests emerged â where windows were smashed on Saturday.
But it is also about a deep distrust of societal institutions that are perceived as working against the interests of the citizens, and that will make this crisis particularly hard for the government to resolve. The Yellow Vests push politicians away and reject Socialists, the far right, President Emmanuel Macronâs political movement, and everybody else in between.
The movement was âtotally unanticipated by the parties,ââ said the political scientist Dominique ReyniÃ©. ââThe system is in crisis.â
In fact, so far at least, Franceâs movement remains relatively unstructured. It has yet to be hijacked by either the far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen, or the far-left leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon, try as they might to claim ownership.
And that is what makes Franceâs movement unique, compared with, say, the 
But Five Star was always less movement than new-age political party. While organized over the internet, it was led by prominent figures (Beppe Grillo, for one) as well as more obscure ones (the 
Much the same can be said of the now-floundering U.K. Independence Party in Britain, which gave voice to Brexit and the publicâs rejection of European Union structures, as well as its class divides with London. Or for that matter, of President Trump, who demonstrates contempt for institutions. His rural and exurban supporters agree with him.
âIt is the same fear, anger and anxiety in France, Italy and the United Kingdom,â said Enrico Letta, a former prime minister of Italy who now teaches at Sciences Po university in Paris. âThese three countries have the highest level of class slippage,â he said.
For the 30 years after World War II, âthey were at the top of the world,â Mr. Letta said, âat the very center.â These countries âused to live with a very high level of average well-being,â he said. âNow, there is a great fear of seeing it all slip away.â
That fear transcends all others. Thus, in Italy, Five-Starâs 
âThereâs this social distress that exists more or less everywhere,â said Marc Lazar, a specialist in Italian history at Sciences Po
Comparing the four countries â Britain, France, Italy and the United States â Christophe Guilluy, a French geographer who has studied the demographics of the âleft-behinds,â said âthe sociology of the people in revolt is the same.â
âThese are the people who feel endangered by the current economic model,â which doesnât âintegrate the greatest number,â he said.
In France, fury at the perceived distance of the executive has not helped the government.
âThe president has not once spoken to the French,â the Yellow Vest spokesman Ãric Drouet said on French TV on Tuesday, referring to Mr. Macronâs relative silence over the last week. âThereâs a total denial by our president.â
There is a paradox in the current French standoff, as Mr. Macronâs rise was itself predicated on sweeping away existing political parties, and on a rejection of traditional intermediaries like labor unions.
His campaign book was called Revolution, and it expressed a kind of contempt for the parties that had handed off power to each other for 50 years. Mr. Macron, by personalizing power and rejecting what had come before, helped create the world of institutional weakness in which the Yellow Vests are now flourishing.
But his base, then and now, was exceedingly small, presaging his current wide rejection by the French, not just by the Yellow Vests. He won only 24 percent of the vote in the first round of voting last year â while his opponents on the far right and far left together won over 40 percent of the vote. Those numbers have now come home to haunt Mr. Macron in a political landscape where nearly eight out of 10 French citizens no longer support him, according to a recent poll.
Mr. Macron, it turns out, is also a change agent out of step with the times, just as Franceâs long delay in biting off structural economic overhauls has left it out of sync with its Western cohort. He is now trying to push through reforms to make France more business-friendly and competitive, as Britain did in the 1980s and Germany in the 1990s. Meanwhile, the global backlash is already cresting, fueled by the income disparities those changes ushered in.
The partial sacking of Parisâs rich, tourism-dominated districts last weekend was merely the physical expression of what all these movements feel deeply, in the view of analysts: hatred of the âwinnersâ in the global system, symbolized by urban elites.
âItâs the provinces against Paris, the proud and contemptuous capital,â Mr. ReyniÃ© said. âAnd Paris has never been so dissimilar to the rest of France. The fracture is very, very sharp.â
The combination of discontent and distrust has made the Yellow Vests an expanding force that almost certainly has yet to reach its limits. The protest has already changed from a revolt over a small gas tax increase to demands for higher salaries, and more.
âRight now, give us more purchasing power,â Jean-FranÃ§ois Barnaba, a Yellow Vest spokesman in the Indre administrative department, told BFM TV on Tuesday.
âThe gas tax was only the beginning,â said Tony Roussel, a spokesman for the movement in Marseille. âNow there are all the other taxes. There are salaries. There is the minimum wage.â
The governmentâs response is especially fraught. On the one hand, top officials express sympathy, not daring otherwise as polls show wide support for the movement; on the other, the same officials are angry and exasperated over the violent challenge to Franceâs institutional structure.
The result is a kind of paralysis, halting adjustments that are only likely to invite more challenges.
âThey still havenât understood our demands,â Mr. Roussel said by telephone this week. âThis was like a firecracker in the water,â he said of the governmentâs decision to suspend a planned gas tax for at least six months.
The protests will go on, he vowed â until deeper concessions are made.

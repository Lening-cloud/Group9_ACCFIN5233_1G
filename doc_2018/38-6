â¢ Banks with assets of $100 billion to $250 billion would no longer need to comply with the liquidity coverage ratio, which is meant to give lenders a cash cushion during a crisis.
â¢ Those same institutions would undergo regulatory stress tests only once every two years, instead of every year.
The Fedâs vice chairman for regulation, Randy Quarles, said the proposed rules would reduce regulatory complexity âwith no decline in the resiliency of the U.S. banking system.â
Opinion on the rules is split. Lael Brainard, a fellow Fed governor, said they would âweaken the buffers that are core to the resilience of our system.â But Greg Baer of the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group, said they donât go far enough.

More details from Kate Conger, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Katie Benner of the NYT:
âWe donât want to feel that weâre unequal or weâre not respected anymore,â said Claire Stapleton, 33, a product marketing manager at Googleâs YouTube who helped call for the walkout. âGoogleâs famous for its culture. But in reality weâre not even meeting the basics of respect, justice and fairness for every single person here.â
Itâs the latest sign of how the tech industryâs rank and file employees are embracing activism â and pushing back against their leaders. Workers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other companies have recently spoken out about their employersâ willingness to work on military projects, the gender pay gap and other issues.
One reason for the outspokenness, 
Last month was painful for investors. At its worst, the S.&P. 500 was down more than 9 percent, though it rebounded in the last few days to finish October with losses of around 7 percent.
Only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. The S.&P. 500 has been dragged down disproportionately by smaller, domestically focused companies, cyclically sensitive industrial firms and global manufacturers like Caterpillar.
And he also lists the issues that spooked investors:
President Trumpâs trade war with China; the Federal Reserveâs stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.
Now what? The WSJ notes that the sell-off across both stocks and bonds 
The streaming service has changed its stance on not showing movies in theaters before streaming them. It will screen three movies that it wants to be considered for Oscars, including Alfonso CuarÃ³nâs âRoma,â in theaters for several weeks before they go online.
More from Brooks Barnes of the NYT on 
Netflixâs modified distribution approach should persuade more theaters to participate. But the move is really about winning Oscars and wooing Hollywood talent.
Academy Awards voters â unlike the Emmys electorate â have been cool to Netflix. Heavyweights like Steven Spielberg, for instance, have chafed at the companyâs policy of streaming movies immediately, suggesting that the serviceâs original films should be considered television. Top directors like Mr. CuarÃ³n, who won an Oscar in 2014 for directing âGravity,â also want their work to be seen on big screens, which has made it harder for Netflix to compete with studios for projects.
But the move will give Netflix a new headache: explaining to its other filmmakers why their productions didnât get a theatrical release.

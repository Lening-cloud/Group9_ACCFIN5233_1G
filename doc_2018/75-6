The stock markets 
Matt Phillips of the NYT explains whatâs driving the rout:
Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And thatâs on top of investorsâ anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.
The drops will

Either way, optimists may find solace in U.S. futures markets trading up slightly this morning, which hints at a brighter start for the day.
President Trump is known for making unsecured phone calls to associates, despite warnings that foreign powers can eavesdrop on them. Now the NYT reports that China has been tapping those calls 
More from Matt Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman of the NYT:
Chinaâs effort is a 21st-century version of what officials there have been doing for many decades, which is trying to influence American leaders by cultivating an informal network of prominent businesspeople and academics who can be sold on ideas and policy prescriptions and then carry them to the White House. The difference now is that China, through its eavesdropping on Mr. Trumpâs calls, has a far clearer idea of who carries the most influence with the president, and what arguments tend to work.
Combined with the eavesdropping is a lobbying effort by Beijing involving close Trump friends like Steve Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and Steve Wynn, the former casino magnate. One U.S. official told the NYT that the Chinese were pushing for those friends to persuade Mr. Trump to sit down with President Xi Jinping of China as often as possible.
Elon Muskâs automaker caught a much-needed break: Yesterday it reported its first quarterly profit in two years, and its biggest ever. As 
The good news saw the 
The profit will help stabilize Teslaâs finances. But the question now is whether the automaker can continue this success. It has struggled to deliver cars to customers, and it hasnât yet rolled out its long-promised $35,000 Model 3. More from Mr. Boudette on what could yet happen:
If sales falter, the company could quickly find itself in a financial squeeze. It has to make bond payments of $230 million in November and $920 million in March. It can use stock for the second payment but only if its share price is above $360. At the same time, Tesla hopes to build a factory in China, which will require hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenses.
The stateâs attorney general 
The suit, built on three years of investigations, does not charge the company with creating climate change. But it claims that the company essentially kept two sets of books when accounting for the effects of global warming: publicly, it claimed to be ready for stringent regulations, while internally it discounted potential costs of climate policies, prosecutors said. Executives as senior as Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon C.E.O. who later became President Trumpâs secretary of state, âknew for yearsâ about the practice, the complaint said.
An Exxon spokesman dismissed the lawsuit as âbaseless.â But as the NYT points out, New York attorneys general have had success bringing shareholder fraud lawsuits before, aided by the stateâs sweeping Martin Act.
At stake isnât just hundreds of millions of dollars in punishment, but also a reputation that Exxon has tried to shape as a global leader on climate change issues.
The company is already the biggest player in the ride-hailing market. But, as it prepares for an I.P.O. next year, Uber is pointing out that its 
That starts with cars, said Mr. Khosrowshahi: âIf thereâs one big goal for Uber, itâs to replace car ownership.â But Uber is also betting on bike and scooter rentals, food delivery, aircraft, and drones. The goal, he said, is to develop four or five multibillion-dollar businesses.
That will come at a cost. Uber is at least a few years away from making money on ride-hailing, and investing in new technologies will require more cash. The company says revenue from mature markets is helping cover costs elsewhere, but prospective investors in its forthcoming I.P.O. will decide if thatâs enough to make a bet on its vision.

LONDON â The defunct political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica violated British law when it used improperly harvested Facebook data to aid Donald J. Trumpâs 2016 presidential campaign, and would face a significant fine if it were not already in bankruptcy, Britainâs top data protection watchdog found Tuesday.
The 
According to the commissionerâs office, the company, Eldon Insurance, shared private email addresses to be sent campaign messages on behalf of Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit group, months before the 2016 referendum on Britainâs membership in the European Union.
The 112-page report underscored how modern political campaigns rely on Facebook data and other consumer information, extracted or bought by consulting firms with little oversight and few protections for consumers. An investigation in March by The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian revealed how Cambridge Analytica â at the time an upstart data firm bankrolled by the conservative billionaire Robert Mercer â had 
The commissionerâs investigation revealed that political campaigns in Britain had exercised little restraint in exploiting consumer data, despite the European Unionâs relatively strict data laws. Political groups were acting more like online businesses and internet marketing firms to target and engage voters, the report concluded.
âWe have uncovered a disturbing disregard for votersâ personal privacy,â the commissioner found.
The finding also adds to legal and political scrutiny of Mr. Banks, who was the single largest donor to the Brexit campaign. His 
Now Mr. Banksâs insurance company and the Leave.EU campaign are facing total fines of 135,000 pounds, or about $177,000, for the privacy breaches, which occurred in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The insurance company owned by Mr. Banks will also be audited, the report said.
But the commissioner rejected accusations that Leave.EU secretly employed Cambridge Analytica â and possibly exploited its Facebook data haul â during the Brexit campaign, potentially violating British election disclosure laws. Though Cambridge Analytica considered working with Leave.EU, and even sent one executive to appear with Leave.EU officials at a news conference, the data company never reached an agreement with the campaign, the commissioner found.
Mr. Banks, sometimes described as the 
But investigators specifically described an improper intermingling of data between Eldon Insurance, Mr. Bankâs company, and the Leave.EU campaign he co-founded.
Investigators said more than one million emails sent to Leave.EU supporters over two separate periods had also included marketing for Eldon Insurance services. Eldon customers also were sent a Leave.EU newsletter, an incident the company described as a mistake in managing an email distribution system.
The two organizations were already known to have close ties, including sharing board members.
The investigation began last year to look into the potential misuse of data in the British referendum on leaving the European Union. But it took on new urgency when The Times, The Observer and The Guardian revealed in March that Cambridge had improperly harvested the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent.
The British investigation involved 71 witnesses, 30 organizations whose data practices were reviewed and 700 terabytes of data â the equivalent of 52 billion pages.
In an earlier report, issued in July, the Information Commissionerâs Office said it had 
In addition to the new details about Mr. Banks, Tuesdayâs report provides more information about the investigation into how Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user data.
The investigation found that Cambridge had nimbly evaded what few restrictions Facebook imposed by contracting with an academic researcher working at Cambridge University, who used an app to harvest the data, almost all of it without the usersâ explicit consent.
The political consulting firm teamed up with the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, who had created an application that collected demographic information, News Feed posts, friend lists, pages that users had liked and other data.
The information was used to create physiological profiles that could guide the targeting of political messages.
In March, officials obtained a warrant to search Cambridge Analyticaâs offices, getting access to mobile phones, storage devices, computers and financial records. At one location, the authorities said, they discovered a number of physically damaged servers, from which investigators were able to recover information.
Investigators said the Information Commissionerâs Office needed more to time to review evidence, including Cambridge Analyticaâs email system, to better determine who had access to data on Facebook users.
âThere are several strands that will take us into the future,â said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner.
Cambridge Analytica announced in May that it was 
In its report on Tuesday, the information commissioner said that had the company still existed, it would have faced âa substantial fine for very serious breachesâ or Britainâs data protection laws. The company, the report added, engaged in âunfairly processing peopleâs personal data for political purposes, including purposes connected with the 2016 U.S. presidential campaigns.â
The report did not draw any conclusions about whether data mining techniques used by Cambridge Analytica and others had determined the outcome of elections in the United States or Britain, but the regulator called on policymakers to draft new laws to restrict how data is collected and shared for political purposes.
âWe may never know whether individuals were unknowingly influenced to vote a certain way in either the U.K. E.U. referendum or the U.S. election campaigns,â the report said. âBut we do know that personal privacy rights have been compromised by a number of players and that the digital electoral ecosystem needs reform.â

When President Trump announced that he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, he left the global environmental campaign without clear leadership. China seems to have assumed the role, but with U.N. climate talks set to take place in Poland next month, there are numerous questions about the direction the Chinese will take.
Worryingly for countries that used to rely on Washington to push for a strong climate agreement, Beijing’s influence could steer the Paris agreement toward a slower pace of climate action, with more flexible rules for developing countries.
Many of President Trump’s policy positions have changed over the decades, but not how he thinks about global trade. That appears 
These days, he uses the same ideas but aims them at China, not Japan. Personal grudges against Beijing may have played a role, as the WSJ points out:
Mr. Trump’s observations on China — based on his own experiences and stories from friends and business associates — gave his old views on trade a new urgency. He could find only Chinese glass and furniture for his buildings, despite looking for U.S.-made versions, he complained. The Trump Organization failed in at least four attempts at property deals in China. He struggled to secure trademarks in the country for the coveted Trump name.
That may mean an end to his trade fight with Beijing won’t come soon. We may find out when he meets with President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires this month.
The Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism, an initiative created by the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism and the consulting firm EY, released a report today outlining important focuses for business in the future.
Among the findings, drawn from comments by over 30 C.E.O.s: better corporate governance, improved human resources management and working with external groups on social and environmental goals.
The take of Mark Weinberger, EY’s global chairman and C.E.O.: “It is time to update how we value companies and measure their impact on all stakeholders, not just shareholders.”
Prosecutors inadvertently mentioned charges against Mr. Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, in an unrelated court filing this year. Mr. Assange has lived for years in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London and would have to be arrested and extradited if he is to face charges in federal court.
The disclosure came as the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is investigating links between President Trump’s associates and Russia’s 2016 election interference. WikiLeaks published thousands of emails that year from Democrats during the presidential race that were stolen by Russian intelligence officers. The hackings were a major part of Moscow’s campaign of disruption.

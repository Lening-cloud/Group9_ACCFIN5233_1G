The legislation builds on a prison reform bill passed by the House this year, and has the potential to bring moderate Republicans and Democrats together to push it through Congress before the end of the current session.

The county sheriff is releasing names of the missing âin waves,â a spokeswoman said, so that officials can handle the volume of calls. The first list named 103 people. âThis in no way is a list of everybody,â she said.

The deal still needs the approval of the British Parliament and European lawmakers, which seems far from certain. Critics argue that it would leave Britain subject to E.U. rules without any say in making them.
So how messy could Brexit be?

Polls have shown the public supports teachers fighting for more pay and classroom funding. And both Democrats and Republicans won races last week after casting themselves as education champions.

Oxfordâs word of the year is chosen to reflect âthe ethos, mood or preoccupationsâ of a particular year, but also to highlight that English is always changing. Last yearâs winner â to the consternation of many â was âyouthquake.â In 2016, it was âpost-truth.â
âYou threw us under the bus!â Sheryl Sandberg yelled.
It was September 2017. And Facebookâs chief operating officer was furious with the companyâs security chief, who had just informed board members that the company still hadnât contained Russian activity on its site.

But now, in the aftermath of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, their fates are unclear.
Neither was among the 18 arrested in Saudi Arabiaâs own investigation into the killing. But Mr. Qahtani has already lost his title as an adviser to the royal court. Mr. Sheikh has since avoided the spotlight.
Saudi watchers say how the royal court deals with them could serve as a bellwether for its direction amid the international backlash.

There are delicate moments in âThe New One,â the comedian Mike Birbigliaâs one-man Broadway show about fatherhood â moments that shouldnât be interrupted by a ringing cellphone or the chime of an incoming text.
But it happens, as it does these days in theaters everywhere.
Often, Mr. Birbiglia, above, deals with the disruptions directly, using humor to turn breaches of etiquette into part of his show.
He talked to our theater reporter about (gently) confronting audience members, 
Early on Thursday, a crew of 15 will transport the Statue of Libertyâs original 3,600-pound, 16-foot torch, made of copper and amber glass, from its storage compartment in the statueâs pedestal to a museum elsewhere on Liberty Island. (A replacement torch, a copper flame covered in 24-karat gold, was added to the statue in 1986.)
Our journalists took 675 photographs to present the torch in augmented reality. 
Have a radiant evening.

Shares in Super Micro, the company whose motherboards were reportedly compromised by Chinese subcontractors, plummeted by over 40 percent yesterday.
But the companies involved have made heated denials:

Bloomberg says the report is based on more than 100 interviews, âincluding government officials and insiders at the companies,â and that it stands behind the article.

Problem is, Canada and Mexico were trying to save a pact that has underpinned their economies for a quarter-century. The E.U. and Japan, both in trade talks with the U.S., wonât be so desperate. As Andre Sapir, a former E.U. economic adviser, told the WSJ: âI donât think Europe will want to enter into such an agreement â it would want to have balanced agreement.â

The off-the-cuff remarks, the âhandsyâ office politics, the clubbable sexism are all being noted. And slowly, the penny is dropping. We donât much care for sexist opinion. And weâre really not impressed by your Rabelaisian past.
The movement appears likely to continue 
But Ms. Ellison adds that many accused men, like the comedian Louis C.K., are working again. And the debate over balancing the rights of the accused with those of the accusers is far from over, as the battle over Brett Kavanaughâs nomination shows. For #MeToo, this may just be the beginning.
The sight of Joel Kaplan, Facebookâs top Washington official, sitting behind his friend Brett Kavanaugh at last weekâs Senate nomination hearing angered many at the social network. They saw it as a kind of an endorsement from the company.
Facebookâs C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, tried to calm concerns during a staff meeting last Friday. 
This week, Facebook employees kept flooding internal forums with comments about Mr. Kaplanâs appearance at the hearing. In a post on Wednesday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive, appeared to dismiss the concerns when he wrote to employees that âit is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.â Facebook plans to hold another staff meeting on Friday to contain the damage, said the current and former employees.
The tensions compound Facebookâs problems, including its 
After the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the country, the E.U. â still in the pact â began trying to shield its companies from the financial penalties. Thereâs more at stake than one agreement.
What the Europeans devised is a âspecial payments entityâ to let companies move money in and out of Tehran when Western banks wonât. While big multinationals have already withdrawn from Iran, others havenât â and Europeans hope that continued trade will keep the nuclear deal alive. (American officials threatened to crack down on any such move.)

The danger for the United States is that the payments mechanism gives the European Union valuable experience operating outside Washingtonâs financial sphere of influence and becomes a permanent part of the international payments system.

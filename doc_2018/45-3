Selling your start-up to Facebook will make you rich, but it might not make you happy. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who sold Instagram to the social networking giant for about $715 million, resigned earlier this week, reportedly over tensions with Mark Zuckerberg about growth.
Brian Acton, one of the co-founders who sold WhatsApp to Facebook for $22 billion, went further. In a 
“They are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople,” Mr. Acton said. “They just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don’t necessarily agree with.”
A senior Facebook executive, David Marcus, pushed back against Mr. Acton, 
Yes, founders take their money and make a choice. But Facebook’s acquisition strategy appears to be stuttering, and its newer products may head in unexpected directions with their founders out of the picture. That’s a problem: Facebook’s acquisitions have been oases of calm and growth compared to its main business.
Masa Son has raised nearly $100 billion for his company’s Vision Fund to invest in tech companies, on what he says is a 300-year strategy. But in a 
That’s an incredible amount of money, and competing investment firms are (understandably) frightened. It’s very different at start-ups, Businessweek points out:
SoftBank has given them the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet of foreign investment dollars. “You think they can’t eat any more,” says Jules Maltz, a partner with IVP, a Sand Hill Road firm. The entrepreneurs “cram it in, put it in their pockets, take doggy bags, whatever.”
The bigger worry might be to SoftBank’s investors: The Vision Fund will need a lot of home-run investments to cover bets that huge.
Executives from Google, Apple, AT&T and more appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday to 
But a clear message emerged from the tech giants: Don’t go too far.
• Amazon’s associate general counsel, Andrew DeVore, asked lawmakers to “ensure that additional overhead and administration demands any legislation might require actually produce commensurate privacy benefits.”
• Keith Enright, Google’s new chief privacy officer, told them to “take into consideration the impacts on service functionality, the consumer benefits of free and low-cost products, the future of the open web and app ecosystem.”
Nothing will happen quickly. “I think we might have a pretty good idea what a draft would look like,”

So he shows no sign of returning to the tradition of presidential silence on fiscal policy. But the Fed still plans another increase before the end of the year, and some of its officials reckon avoiding inflation will require raising rates to the point of restricting the economy.
For his part, Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chief, said yesterday: “We don’t consider political factors.”
The sportswear company’s decision to feature Colin Kaepernick in its latest ads has been celebrated as shrewd marketing. But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.
Then 
Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.
Another factor: Under Nike’s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can’t sell league-branded merchandise after 2020. That helped it choose to put Mr. Kaepernick front and center. So far, the wager is paying off.
The stock market may face a new threat: 
Buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders with 3 percent a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process. Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off.
And:
If companies’ profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds. But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year. And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more. In that case, the difference between the 10-year yield and the earnings yield would shrink even more. Investors may be more tempted then to shed stocks and put more money into bonds.

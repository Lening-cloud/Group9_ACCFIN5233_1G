If President Trump sought to end debate over Americaâs ties to Saudi Arabia with his pledge of support, he fell short, Andrew writes in 
Mr. Trump may think he has gained the loyalty of the crown prince by standing by him, but if Congress moves to enact sanctions, the economic fallout could be serious for the kingdom, which the president has been encouraging to hold down oil prices.
Between the economic pressures that Saudi Arabia is increasingly facing â the price of oil is hovering around $50 a barrel when the kingdom needs it to sell for $70 to maintain its budget â and the executives who are rightly skittish about investing there, Mr. Trump may have pushed Congress toward taking actions that create more problems.

His timing is inflammatory. Mr. Trump is scheduled to sit down with President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 meeting later this week, with trade top of the agenda. Officials from both sides have been speaking for weeks, with China 
Mr. Trump also said that if he couldnât reach a trade deal, he would impose tariffs of either 10 percent or 25 percent on the rest of the goods America imports from China, another $267 billion worth. (American consumers could stand a 10 percent price hike on products like iPhones â

The cryptocurrency plummeted in value between December and February, to $7,000 from $19,000, then hovered between $6,000 and $7,000 for months. Now itâs below $4,000. 
But if thatâs the case, who would buy up the currency as it falls through the floor? More from Mr. Laurent:
The defenders of the faith with the resources to influence the price are more likely to be large, centralized actors like big mining operations, exchanges or the 500-odd addresses with more than $10 million of Bitcoin to their name, not a committed community of tech geeks.
Tether, which provides crypto tokens that it says are backed one-to-one with real currencies like dollars, is a prime candidate, Mr. Laurent says. But there are accusations that such tokens have been used to prop up Bitcoin illegally, and the Justice Department is investigating. That may further dim the hopes of a recovery.

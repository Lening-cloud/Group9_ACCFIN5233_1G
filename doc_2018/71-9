What the Fed said in its statement today:
The boardâs action will restrict Wells Fargoâs growth until its governance and risk management sufficiently improves but will not require the firm to cease current activities, including accepting customer deposits or making consumer loans.
And hereâs what Janet Yellen, in one of her final acts as Fed chairwoman, 
âWe cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank and the consumers harmed by Wells Fargo expect that robust and comprehensive reforms will be put in place to make certain that the abuses do not occur again.â
Shares in Wells Fargo were down nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading.

Among them:
â¢ Submitting plans to further improve both corporate governance and compliance operations
â¢ Have third parties conduct reviews of those plans and how well they work
â¢ Having another third party review risk management practices after the Fedâs limit on asset growth is removed
Hereâs what Tim Sloan, Wells Fargoâs C.E.O., said:
âWe take this order seriously and are focused on addressing all of the Federal Reserveâs concerns. It is important to note that the consent order is not related to any new matters, but to prior issues where we have already made significant progress.â

Rising anxiety over inflation and rising rates 
The S&P 500 fell 2.1 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2 percent.
The plunge marked a stark shift in investor sentiment. Stocks have glided higher for two years, lifted by solid economic growth and corporate profits, low interest rates and few signs of inflation.
That smooth ride might now be ending.
Climbing bond yields have weighed heavily on stocks this week. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury finished at 2.85 percent Friday, up from 2.66 percent a week ago, and at its highest level in four years. The Dow industrials finished the week off 4.1 percent, its biggest drop since January 2016.
By historical standards, Fridayâs sell-off falls well short of some of historyâs biggest. In fact, it doesnât even crack the top 1,000, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Here are the top five:
1) -23.52 percent (12/12/1914)
2) -22.61 percent (10/19/1987)
3) -12.82 percent (10/28/1929)
4) -11.73 percent (10/29/1929)
5) -9.92 percent (11/06/1929)
Mr. Huntsman 
He built his fortunes â and his familyâs power within the state of Utah â thanks to the fortunate marriage of chemicals and fast food. His chemical company won a contract to create a foam clamshell container for McDonaldâs Big Mac, a business win that turned Huntsman into an industrial powerhouse.
He later turned to philanthropy, and in particular support for cancer research. He also was a founder of Huntsman Gay Global Capital, a private equity firm known today as HGGC.
Mr. Huntsman is survived by his children, including Jon Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor and presidential candidate, and Peter Huntsman, who now runs the Huntsman chemical company.
The United States economy 
â¢ The unemployment rate was at 4.1 percent, the same as in December and the lowest since 2000
â¢ Average earnings rose by 9 cents an hour and are up 2.9 percent over the past year.
â¢ Revisions in the November and December figures produced a net loss of 24,000 jobs.
Economists warned about reading too much into Januaryâs strong wage numbers â several times during the recovery, wage growth has appeared to accelerate, only to fall back to earth. But they said there was little doubt that the latest numbers were an encouraging sign.
â¢ âWage gains for non-supervisory workers is less headline worthy, being 2.4% Y/Y, but the underlying trend is still up. Greater growth in lower wage industries remains the underpinning of the jobs market,â Steven Blitz of TS Lombard writes.
â¢ âIn a rational world, this would be a major inflection point stimulating profound public debate, Congressional hearings and a Presidential commission to map out possible policy paths in an age of Artificial Intelligence. Instead all we get is an already tired juvenile discussion around who gets political credit for the secular improvement in job creation and the economy,â Joseph Brusuelas of RSM US writes.
The computer maker 
â¢ Dell is under pressure to increase profits after its debt-laden, $67 billion 
â¢ It faces increased competition in its core hardware businesses and from cloud-based services provided by Amazon, Microsoft and others.
â¢ Dell went private five years ago in a $24.9 billion deal with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners.
â¢ In 2016, Dell bought EMC for $67 billion. EMC owned 81 percent of VMware, which was publicly traded.
The iPhone maker holds $269 billion in cash abroad and has said it will be bringing the vast majority of that back home thanks to the new tax law.
On Thursdayâs earnings conference call, the company indicated it wonât be just sitting on that pile cash either.
Hereâs what Luca Maestri, Appleâs chief financial officer, said:
âOur current net cash position is $163 billion, and given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time.â
When asked about M.&A., Mr. Maestri responded:
âThe thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product road maps, filling a gap in our portfolio, providing a new experience to customers. So itâs always the customer experience in mind, right, that we make acquisitions. We look at all sizes, and we will continue to do so. We have plenty of financial flexibility, of course. We had that even prior to tax reform.â

The stock is down 5.8 percent Friday after its earnings fell short of analystsâ expectations.
Exxonâs shares have underperformed over the last 12 months even as the price oil has rebounded. The stock is 0.6 percent over the past year, compared with a 222 percent gain in the Standard & Poorâs 500 index.

â¢ Tara Lachapelle writes: âCBS isnât safe from the industryâs broad ratings pressure and subscriber declines, which is why scale is important. Viacom wonât provide enough of it, but it will offer substantial cost-saving opportunities.â (
â¢ The analyst Rich Greenfield writes: âCBS needs far greater scale and a recombination with Viacom is the most logical first step, albeit only a first step with several follow-on strategic moves needed (acquisitions or merger with an even larger entity).â (

LONDON â To many people, a school photograph is a forgettable moment of childhood that often causes mild embarrassment later on.
But to the British artist and director Steve McQueen â the man behind the Oscar-winning â12 Years a Slaveâ and the coming âWidowsâ â that photograph can be much more: a chance to reflect on societyâs diversity and innocent potential.
For his latest art project, Mr. McQueen will take that idea and multiply. He announced on Tuesday that he would try to take a class photograph at 2,410 schools in London, capturing 115,000 children ages 7 to 8.
The photographs are to go on display at Tate Britain in London from November 2019, Mr. McQueen said in a news conference at the gallery. A major survey of his art will run alongside the exhibition from February 2020.
Mr. McQueen said the idea had come to him while reflecting on his own childhood. âAt a certain point in oneâs life, you look backwards and ask, âWhere is so and so? Whatâs happened to them?â â he said, while sitting next to a screen showing his own class photograph at that age. âI just wanted to reflect back on a certain point in my life where things changed and things churned.â
At the age of 7, ideas around identity have not yet taken hold of children, Mr. McQueen said. Referring later to his own soccer-obsessed school days, he said: âAt the time, it was all about football and girls. âOh, heâs from Pakistan. Heâs from Iran. Who cares? Whereâs the ball?â â
As well as looking back, he said the project would allow him âto reference where we are and where we come from.â 
Mr. McQueen said the project was conceived before Britainâs vote to leave the European Union â the process known as Brexit. People will pile political meaning onto the artwork, he acknowledged, but that happens with any undertaking. âYou canât avoid that, it is what it is,â he said.
The project has taken a long time to prepare, partly because it involved getting permission from every school and parent. Eventually, 30 photographers will work on the project; six have already been recruited and will start work immediately. Mr. McQueen will brief each one, but he will not take photographs himself. âIâll leave it to the professional photographers,â he said.
Mr. McQueen is well known as an artist in Britain, having won the Turner Prize, the countryâs major contemporary art award, in 1999. In 2007, he created â
Mr. McQueen said he would not have a hard time explaining his latest project to the children involved if he had to. âI think people often think theyâre insignificant,â he said, explaining that the photographs were a way of making a different point: âYouâre important â I want to take a photograph of you.â Young people will also grasp the significance of the project when their photographs go on display in one of the worldâs leading art institutions, he said. â I remember well when I was 5 and I had a painting of mine exhibited in the local library.â
Maria Balshaw, the Tateâs director, said in an interview that she thought Mr. McQueen had seen in the project a âsense of showing future creative potential which is there in every class.â She said she hoped the work would highlight the importance of arts education in Britain, which has been suffering because of government funding cuts.
âIn the 1970s, I was at an open-plan, arts-centered primary school that allowed every lesson to have the arts in it, and Iâm certain that set us on a road where a sense of creative agency was part of our lives,â she said.

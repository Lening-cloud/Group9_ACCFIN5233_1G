The list of finalists leans toward cities in the Midwest and on the East Coast, and away from the tech-saturated hubs of the West Coast. Many of the finalists have been considered shoo-ins from the moment Amazon announced the search, largely because of the attributes Amazon said it was seeking for its new home â including a metropolitan area with a population more than one million and the ability to attract and keep strong technical talent.

Ignore all the one-time charges related to the new tax law that banks announced this week, the industry, long-term, should be among the biggest winners.

Yet despite this largess, âthe industry stands to retain more than 75 percents of the savingsâ from the tax law, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Wednesday, shares of the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 26,000, the Standard & Poorâs 500 index finished above 2,800, and 
Investors have piled into stocks to start 2018. It took the Dow industrials just eight trading sessions to go from 25,000 to 26,000, the fastest move between millennial markers on record.
So far this month, the S. & P. 500 has risen about 4.8 percent this month. To put that into context, the last time the index climbed 5 percent in January was 2013 and the last 6 percent gain for the month was in 1997. In both years, equities went on the finish the year up more than 30 percent, according to Instinetâs Frank Cappelleri.
So what could derail the stock marketâs rally? A government shutdown? Escalating tensions with North Korea? Right now neither is weighing on stocks very much.

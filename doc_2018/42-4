If the commission convinces a jury that Mr. Musk misled investors, he could be blocked from serving as an executive or director of any public company. That could force him to assume a different position at Tesla. It could also affect his other companies, SpaceX and the Boring Company, were they to go public, and potentially harm their ability to raise money from investors.
The S.E.C. lawsuit, filed on Thursday in federal court, said that Mr. Musk had made a false public statement by tweeting that he had “funding secured” to buy out Tesla investors. Some legal experts think he has a tough battle ahead: Charles Elson of the University of Delaware called the case “
Andrew’s take:
Mr. Musk will want to prove that his intent wasn’t to mislead investors, probably by demonstrating that he had real conversations to take the company private. But his intent is almost beside the point. He can be found guilty simply for being “reckless.” And naïveté isn’t a defense.
This is turning into a sad story for Tesla’s employees, investors and ultimately everyone who has followed Mr. Musk’s efforts to transform the auto and energy industries.

In March 2017, State Street Global Advisors, one of the world’s largest fund managers, pushed companies to put more women on corporate boards. FactSet has crunched the numbers, and there’s a long way to go:
• Companies in the Russell 3000 stock index with no female board members declined to 18 percent, from 23 percent.
• Companies in which women hold 15 percent of the board seats or less decreased to 47 percent, from 58 percent.
• The boards of 22 companies are equally split between men and women, while women make up the majority at 14 companies, up from five.
• Just 5 percent of companies in the index are led by women, unchanged from March 2017.
The yield curve is essentially the difference between interest rates on short-term government bonds and long-term government bonds. Every time since 1960 that it has inverted — when long-term rates are lower than short-term rates — a recession has followed. For much of this year, the spread has been at its narrowest level in more than a decade. Many economists believe it will invert next year.
But Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, has played down the yield curve’s significance as an omen. The curve is “

Six-year-old Bytedance, which was said to be seeking around $3 billion in the current round, started out by using artificial intelligence to personalize content for users but has successfully branched out into short-video via a service called Douyin, known as Tik Tok abroad. That service had 500 million monthly active users as of July. It also owns the Musical.ly app, which has about 100 million users and is being merged with Tik Tok, the company said in August.
One reason for investor caution: With companies like Tencent getting involved in short video, Tik Tok may struggle to grow in a saturated market.

But he also wonders what might happen if other companies embraced its vision:
If Apple’s more deliberate business becomes the widely followed norm, we could see an industry that is more careful about tech’s dangers and excesses. It could also be one that is more exclusive, where the wealthy get the best innovations and the poor bear more of the risks.
The financial crisis ruined Goldman Sachs’s reputation in the eyes of the public. Ten years on, it is finally out of the doghouse.
But let’s not get carried away. On YouGov’s reputation scale, which runs from -100 to 100, Goldman crawled into positive territory with a score of 1.

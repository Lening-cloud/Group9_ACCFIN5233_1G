SNIADOWO, Poland â The young mayor of this small town deep in eastern Poland is extremely proud of its new Italian fire engine, which sits, resplendent, next to a Soviet-era one. Nearby, the head of the elementary school shows off new classrooms and a new gymnasium, complete with an electronic scoreboard.
All of this â plus roads, solar panels, and improved water purification and sewer systems, as well as support to dairy farmers â has largely been paid for by the European Union, which finances 
With such largess, one would hardly think that Poland is in a kind of war with the European Union. In recent months, the nationalist government has bitten the hand that feeds it more than once.
The European Union has accused Poland of posing a grave risk to democratic values, accusing it of undermining the rule of law by 
The tug of war has intensified as Eastern Europe becomes the incubator for a new model of âilliberal democracyâ for which 
The stakes, many believe, far outweigh those of Britainâs exit from the European Union, or Brexit, as the bloc faces a painful reckoning over whether, despite its efforts at discipline, it has enabled the anti-democratic drift, and what to do about it.
The growing conflict between the original Western member states of the bloc and the newer members in Central and Eastern Europe is the main threat to the cohesion and survival of the European Union. It is not a simple clash, but a multibannered one of identity, history, values, religion and interpretations of democracy and âsolidarity.â
âItâs yes to Europe, but what Europe?â said 
The Polish government, which is dominated by the Law and Justice party, itself dominated from the back rooms by the party chief, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, seems to have its own answer to the question.
It is more than happy to take European Union economic support, but worries that Polandâs share could dwindle if the member nations use the budget to pressure Poland to fall in line. The country is to get nearly 9 percent of the European Union budget for 2014 to 2020, 
But the vague threats to apply the brakes to the gravy train are unlikely to push the Kaczynski government to change. It has responded to European criticism by accusing Brussels and Germany â until recently Polandâs greatest ally in Europe â of dictating terms to newer members and trying to impose an elitist, secular vision. It has also positioned itself at the forefront of central and eastern European nations opposing migration quotas, saying it is acting in defense of Christian values.
The governing party has campaigned on Polish national pride and âgetting up off our knees;â it has also portrayed predominantly Roman Catholic Poland, which traditionally sees itself as a victim of history, as the âChrist of nations.â
After being squeezed between empires and occupied in turns by fascism and communism, Poland is ready to take its place as an equal, Mr. Kaczynski asserts, no longer relegated to serfdom or secondary status.
âThe history is part of our identity, which people in other parts of the world donât understand,â said 
This combination of Polish nationalism, religious conservatism, anti-elitism and attacks on those supposedly seeking to dictate to Poland about values and migrant quotas has made Law and Justice by far the largest party in a divided country with a disorganized political opposition.
The party has risen from almost 38 percent of the vote in the 2015 election to about 47 percent in recent opinion polls. Much of that success is attributed to its investment in the poorer countryside, and much of the money for that investment is attributed to European Union support and access to its markets and jobs.
But more than money, Law and Justice thrives on cultural and identity politics. It has contrasted a conservative, Catholic Poland and its family values with a godless, freethinking, gender-bending Western Europe.
It accuses past governments, the opposition and the urban elites of hankering after European approval and acceptance to the detriment of Polish interests.
Sniadowo district, a collection of villages northeast of Warsaw with roughly 5,500 people, reflects that support. While the pre-World War II population was about 40 percent Jewish, today it is Kaczynski country.
The area is profoundly Roman Catholic and deeply affected by its proximity to Belarus and the memories of the Soviet occupation of World War II. In 2015, roughly 70 percent of voters in the region supported Law and Justice.
People go to church several times a week, priests tend to give passionate, political sermons, and state and church media give a partisan version of events.
âPromoting same-sex marriage will not go down well here,â said Marek Adam Komorowski, 58, a local councilman in nearby Lomza. âIf you are in Europe, you canât speak against it, but it is not a norm here. Here, family means something else.â
Rafal Pstragowski, the 37-year-old mayor of Sniadowo, an independent in his seventh year in office, echoed the sentiments. âPoland is a traditional Christian country and Poland respects other religions,â he said, âbut we want our culture to be respected, too.â
âThere is a fear among people that Western secularism is a threat to our traditional culture,â he added. âIf things in Europe keep going in the same direction, people think that the migration crisis and terrorist attacks could start here, too.ââ
As for the fight with the European Union over the governmentâs control of the judiciary, that âseems abstract,â said Agnieszka Walczuk, 45, the director of the townâs elementary school. âThe people here are poor, and they feel they have been helped by a government seen as protecting them,â she said.
The recent squabble over 
While firmly in favor of membership, Law and Justice has a vision of the European Union similar to the British one â a union of nation states trading freely with one another but not interfering in domestic politics or national culture.
At the same time, Poland sees an emerging vision for Europe, under the proposals of Franceâs president, Emmanuel Macron, as reviving French-German domination of the bloc, which would leave Poland more sidelined.
In Polandâs view, talk of restricting the rights of foreign workers in France is protectionist and aimed at the new member states, but wrapped in pro-European language. Poland rejects a âmultilevelâ or âtwo-speedâ Europe, with an inner core of eurozone states and an outer ring of lesser members. But it sees Brussels heading that way regardless.
In general, Mr. Kaczynskiâs priority is domestic, âand for control of the judiciary, heâs ready to pay almost any price,â said 
The changes, the ruling party argues, are necessary to clear out an old Communist elite, but they are ârendering the independence of the judiciary completely moot,â 
âThe constitutionality of legislation can no longer be guaranteed,â he said, because âthe countryâs judiciary is now under the political control of the ruling majority.â
The European Union has warned Poland officially, charging that Warsaw risks âa serious breachâ of its commitment to shared values of liberal democracy and the rule of law, principles that all member states have sworn to uphold.
Some think that Warsaw and Brussels will compromise somehow. But that is difficult to foresee. Mr. Buras sees in Mr. Kaczynski a pessimism about the European project.
âHe thinks that this E.U. is doomed to fail, and so we need to save ourselves,â Mr. Buras said. âHe believes that it cannot survive.â
That concerns Ms. Walczuk, the school director, who remembers the paucity of her choices under Communism and worries about the future of her daughter, 16, and son, 12.
âI fear this fight with Brussels might limit my childrenâs right to work and travel in Europe,â she said. âI know my kids have no sense of not having anything, no sense that they should say something, to stand up for their rights, and this worries me.â

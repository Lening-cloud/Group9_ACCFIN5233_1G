Rivals and adversaries are challenging the United States on many fronts and in many domains. America’s ability to defend its allies, its partners, and its own vital interests is increasingly in doubt. If the nation does not act promptly to remedy these circumstances, the consequences will be grave and lasting.
The commission noted that authoritarian nations like China and Russia were seeking “the means to project power globally,” and added that “the proliferation of advanced technology is allowing more actors to contest U.S. military power in more threatening ways.”
Its report suggested a number of priorities for Congress. Its conclusion: “Innovations in operational concepts and leap-ahead technologies are vital to sustaining U.S. military advantages” in the long term.

Britain’s decision to leave the European Union provides pointers for investors as President Trump ratchets up trade tensions with China.
In the weeks following Britain’s vote in 2016 for “Brexit,” fears grew that the post-war economic order was under serious threat. But European stock markets recovered, including Britain’s. Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up, and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy. Looking back, the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system. Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective.
Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump’s trade policies. China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening. Reacting to China’s announcement, the S.&P. 500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1.2 percent.
Investors may believe China’s move will lead to drawn-out negotiations. Here, Brexit is again illustrative. As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on, investors have gained more clarity and confidence. If talks between the U.S. and China gain steam, the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear.
But the standoff between the U.S. and China differs in important ways from the Brexit tensions. The U.S., for instance, is in a much stronger position than Britain. China exports far more to the U.S. than the U.S. does to China. Limiting access to the U.S. economy could hurt China’s growth at a time when it is trying to overhaul important economic sectors. If investors believe that the U.S. can successfully exploit its advantages to make China more friendly to foreign businesses, they may even see the trade skirmish as positive for the global economy.
But Brexit also flashes a warning to those expecting a big win for Mr. Trump. One of the reasons that the European Union has presented a united front is that it sees Brexit as a threat to its values and goals. Similarly, China may believe that Mr. Trump’s trade attack puts some of its most deeply held aspirations under threat – and will fight back hard.
After Citigroup announced plans to limit firearms sales by business customers, the question was which lenders would be the next to make a move on guns. The latest: Amalgamated Bank, the union-owned bank known for its socially minded policies.
The firm said on Wednesday that 
Among 
• Require gun dealers to protect merchandise from burglary and theft and refuse sales to people who appear in distress or intoxicated
• Require retailers to stop selling high-capacity magazines and bump stocks
• Require gun makers to “commit to developing innovations in firearms that will allow law enforcement to more easily solve gun crimes”
Amalgamated said that it would not only require all business customers to adhere to those guidelines but added that it won’t invest any of its own money in gun manufacturers or distributors.
Here’s what Amalgamated’s C.E.O. Keith Mestrich, said in a news release:
“Collectively, banks and lenders have the power to promote responsible business practices from gun manufacturers and distributors, and ultimately contribute to a safer society for all. Amalgamated will do whatever we can to achieve that goal and we hope other banks and financial institutions will agree and act.”

Facebook on Wednesday 
The new figure sharply increased the company’s previous estimate of how many users’ information was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. The number had been put at more than 50 million users.
The sharing of the user data has unleashed a torrent of criticism at Facebook, the world’s largest social network. The company’s stock is down sharply since The New York Times and The Observer of London reported on how Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired users’ data.
The company released the revised estimate of affected users in an extended statement on Wednesday about its plans for handling personal data. The company said it will start alerting users on April 9 about whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.
• Earlier on Wednesday, lawmakers in Washington had said Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, would testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11 about the company’s handling of sensitive user data.

The big question: Is a full-blown trade war coming? 
And is dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average. The blue-chip index is off nearly 350 points, or 1.4 percent. That slide is worse than the declines of the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, which are both down less than 1 percent.
Boeing’s 4 percent fall has shaved 87 points off the Dow Wednesday. Boeing is the highest priced stock in the price-weighted index, which means Boeing has an outsized impact on the index’s moves.
Boeing’s shares have served as a proxy for investor concern about a possible trade war with China since the Trump administration announced tariffs on aluminum and steel.
Over that period, the stock has fallen 12 percent.
The streaming-music company’s shares opened at $165.90, but they steadily decline throughout their first day of trading, closing at $149.01.
The stock is down 4.1 percent to $142.91 in early trading Wednesday.
Because Spotify eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing, there is no I.P.O. price off which to base the performance of its shares. But the company’s current shares price remains well above the $132.50 its private shares changed hands at earlier this year.

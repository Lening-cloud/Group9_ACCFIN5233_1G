Shares of Starbuckâs fell as much as 2.8 percent in late trading after 
Mr. Schultzâs decision to retire will most likely stoke speculation that he is considering a run for president in 2020. On Monday, he acknowledged for the first time that it is something he may consider:
âI want to be truthful with you without creating more speculative headlines. For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country â the growing division at home and our standing in the world.
âI want to be truthful with you without creating more speculative headlines. For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country â the growing division at home and our standing in the world.â
Under Mr. Schultzâs three decades managing the company, Starbucks grew from a tiny local chain into a global coffee giant, operating 28,000 stores in 75 countries. Shares of Starbucks have risen 21,000 percent since the companyâs initial public offering in 1992; an investor who had put in $10,000 then would have more than $2 million today.
Microsoftâs planned acquisition of GitHub, a software development company, is not close to the companyâs largest, and it will not have a big, immediate impact on profits.
But the deal is a milestone because it reveals the degree to which the rise in Microsoftâs stock has bolstered its heft as an acquirer.
Microsoftâs stock has gone up more than 200 percent since Microsoft agreed in 2013 to pay $7.2 billion in cash for Nokiaâs handset and services operations. That price tag amounted to 2.6 percent of Microsoftâs total market value back then. The $7.5 billion Microsoft is paying for GitHub is just under 1 percent of Microsoftâs current market capitalization. This lessens the financial hit if the acquisition falls short of expectations, but increases the upside if it outperforms.
In recent years, Microsoftâs valuation has also increased, making its stock even more potent as an acquisition currency. Microsoftâs shares currently trade at around 24 times the earnings that analysts expect over the next 12 months, according to data from CapitalIQ. Thatâs far higher than the 15 times it traded at in mid-2013.
But Microsoft might still find it hard to buy a big, top-performing technology company. Take Salesforce, the cloud-software company that Microsoft 
But it would be a mistake to conclude that Microsoft has not advanced in the market for acquisitions. Its soaring stock has made sure the company has remained a player in the deals game. The jump in its price-to-earnings ratio makes it more likely that a large deal would bolster earnings per share (after factoring in the extra shares issued to do the deal.) With its operations notching up strong organic growth, Microsoft probably does not need to do a big deal anytime soon. But if one were to crop up, shareholders may not balk.
In the past four years, Microsoftâs stock has risen by 150 percent, and the company now looks 
Satya Nadella happened, for one. (He succeeded Steve Ballmer as C.E.O. of Microsoft in 2014.) And the cloud, for another.
Mr. Ballmer tried to target the flashier end of the consumer hardware market, with things like Windows Phone and the Zune music player. It didnât work. In contrast, Mr. Nadella has focused on enterprise applications â and in particular, found huge success in cloud computing.
And the growth of its cloud operations has been huge. From Steve Lohr of the NYT, 
Since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, the cloud portion of Microsoftâs revenue has soared from 3 percent to more than 21 percent this year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse. Microsoft finished 2017 with 13 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to Synergy Research Group, a gain of three percentage points during the year.
The company lags only Amazon Web Services as a cloud provider.
Mr. Nadella is also gearing up for the next big thing to be put into the cloud: artificial intelligence.
Because such software is computationally demanding, it makes sense to pay for someone else to run programs on huge servers rather than buying oneâs own hardware. But itâs also complex, which means that there is going to be a huge market for user-friendly software that can be taken up by regular developers and not just people with A.I. Ph.D.s.
Thatâs why thereâs a big race right now â between the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others â to offer up tools in the cloud that can process huge data sets and provide useful insights about them.
Microsoftâs latest acquisition, of the online code repository GitHub, fits neatly into that vision: it could help the company build out large and powerful suites of A.I. software, that are constantly updated by experts. So does a

What Satya Nadella, Microsoftâs C.E.O., said of the transaction:
Under the terms of the deal, a senior Microsoft executive, Nat Friedman, will become GitHubâs C.E.O., while the coding hubâs current chief, Chris Wanstrath, will become a Microsoft technical fellow. The acquisition is expected to close by year end.
Hereâs where the deal ranks among Microsoftâs biggest acquisitions, according to data from Dealogic. (It excludes transactions where Microsoft was in a consortium, such as the

The technology giant struck data-sharing partnerships with at least 60 device makers â including Amazon, Apple, BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung â over the last decade. The company claimed that those deals were supposed to make it easier for people to use Facebook before its app was widely available on smartphones. But 
More from Gabriel J.X. Dance, Nicholas Confessore and Michael LaForgia:
Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of usersâ friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from usersâ friends who believed they had barred any sharing.
Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, has been adamant that his company stringently protects its customersâ data privacy. Two news stories raise some questions about that categorical claim.
Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal blew up for Facebook, Mr. Cook has pointed out that Apple makes money from selling products, not advertising. Heâs even pointed out that Apple misses out on a big revenue stream as a result, 
The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product. Weâve elected not to do that.
So, to the stories. First, thereâs 
An Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.
Not too incriminating. But itâs a reminder that Apple has made use of the data that passes across Facebookâs platform.
Then there was the 
Over the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.
Under the concept discussed internally and raised with potential partners, users searching in Pinterestâs app for âdrapesâ might turn up an ad distributed by Apple for an interior-design app, or Snap users searching for âNFLâ might see an ad for a ticket-reseller app, one of the people said.
If that becomes a reality, it would position Apple as a competitor of Facebook and Google in the world of digital advertising. Itâs hard to see how that 
(Worth noting: it wouldnât be the first time that Apple has flirted with advertising. Its mobile advertising platform, iAds, was supposed to allow third-party developers to embed ads into their apps. 
None of this is to say that Apple doesnât act by its word. But it is an important reminder to continue asking whether it really does.
The latest installment in the movie franchise, âSolo,â had its second disappointing weekend, pulling in just $29.3 million in the U.S. (We use âjustâ advisedly.) But perhaps more important, it raises questions about the future of what is supposed to be one of Walt Disneyâs biggest moneymakers.

Disney has much riding on âStar Warsâ movies continuing to generate windfalls at the box office,
The trend hasnât been reassuring, though. Disney likely took about $1 billion from âThe Force Awakens,â after accounting for production and marketing costs. But âThe Last Jedi,â the next movie in the main series, showed a marked drop. (To be fair, âThe Force Awakensâ was the first new âStar Warsâ movie in more than a decade.)
But âSoloâ may highlight the pitfalls. Disney has said that it plans to release a new âStar Warsâ movie every year, raising the real risk that moviegoers could end up suffering from Force fatigue. Just five months separated âSoloâ from âThe Last Jedi.â Forcing through more movies â and video content for Disneyâs forthcoming streaming service â could erode the uniqueness that once defined the franchiseâs installments.
Then thereâs quality control. The studio has already struggled with turmoil at the production of â

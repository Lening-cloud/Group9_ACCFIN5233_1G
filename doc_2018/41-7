“Tonight, it is my honor and privilege to announce that I will nominate Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court.” “Mr. President, thank you. Throughout this process, I have witnessed firsthand your appreciation for the vital role of the American judiciary. No president has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination. Mr. President, I am grateful to you. And I’m humbled by your confidence in me. Thank you. Thirty years ago, President Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court. The framers established that the Constitution is designed to secure the blessings of liberty. Justice Kennedy devoted his career to securing liberty. I am deeply honored to be nominated to fill his seat on the Supreme Court. My mom was a teacher. In the 1960s and ‘70s she taught history at two largely African-American public high schools in Washington D.C., McKinley Tech and H.D. Woodson. Her example taught me the importance of equality for all Americans. My mom was a trailblazer. When I was 10, she went to law school and became a prosecutor. My introduction to law came at our dinner table when she practiced her closing arguments. Her trademark line was, ‘Use your common sense. What rings true? What rings false?’ That’s good advice for a juror and for a son. My wife, Ashley, is a West Texan, a graduate of Abilene Cooper Public High School and the University of Texas. She is now the town manager of our community. We met in 2001 when we both worked in the White House. Our first date was on September 10th, 2001. The next morning I was a few steps behind her as the Secret Service shouted at all of us to sprint out the front gates of the White House because there was an inbound plane. In the difficult weeks that followed, Ashley was a source of strength for President Bush and for everyone in this building. Through bad days, and so many better days since then, she has been a great wife, an inspiring mom. I thank God everyday for my family. Tomorrow I begin meeting with members of the Senate, which plays an essential role in this process. I will tell each senator that I revere the Constitution. I believe that an independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic. If confirmed by the Senate, I will keep an open mind in every case. And I will always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law. Thank you, Mr. President.”
• After an 18-day drama that captured the world’s attention, all 12 boys and their soccer coach have been evacuated from the flooded cave where they were trapped. 
Four members of the Thai military who had been staying with the boys are also being brought out.
“We are not sure if this is a miracle, a science, or what. All the thirteen Wild Boars are now out of the cave,” a post on the Thai Navy SEAL Facebook page announced today, referring to the soccer team’s nickname.

Under the so-called Flores agreement of 1997, children must be released to licensed care programs within 20 days. The government had argued that long-term confinement was the only way to avoid separating families when parents were detained on criminal charges.

• Eight months before Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union, 
Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and one of the most ardent advocates of leaving the bloc, joined the Brexit secretary, David Davis, in stepping down after Mrs. May pushed ahead with a proposal that would keep Britain more closely tied to the Continent than hard-line conservatives want.
The resignations reveal the intensity of the split in the prime minister’s cabinet and renewed questions about whether her leadership would be challenged.

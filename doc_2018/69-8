CBSâs longtime C.E.O. 
Mr. Moonvesâs severance package will depend on the result of the companyâs investigation into the claims. He could walk away with over $120 million â or nothing. (The advocacy group Times Up demanded â
The situation raises more questions about why Mr. Moonves would put himself under increased scrutiny by picking a fight with CBSâs controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, this year. That legal battle was also settled Sunday night, and the company added six new directors, including three women.
Not much will change for CBS in the short term, with Mr. Moonvesâs top lieutenant, Joseph Ianniello, taking over as interim C.E.O.
Ms. Redstone had wanted to merge the company with Viacom, but the settlement delays any such push for two years. 
Daniel Zhang, Alibabaâs C.E.O., will become chairman â though with a 6 percent stake Mr. Ma will continue to exert influence over the company. âAlibaba was never about Jack Ma, but Jack Ma will forever belong to Alibaba,â he wrote in a 
His departure comes at a tough time for Alibaba and its peers. Beijing is tightening control of tech companies, which has squeezed a top rival, Tencent. And the Chinese economy is slowing, wounding competitors like JD.com.
Alibaba is faring better. But 
The Swedish carmaker had intended to go public by the end of the year, at a market value of $30 billion. But the company fears that the risk of its valuation falling below that is now too high, so it has 
Volvoâs C.E.O., Hakan Samuelsson, told the FT that âconditions right now are not optimal,â adding that outcomes of trade discussions between China, Europe, and the U.S. were âreally difficult to predict.â He said that prospective investors, particularly Swedish pension funds, could be hurt by a drop in valuation. Instead, Volvo would prefer âstable market conditions.â
The company is taking steps to avoid U.S. tariffs, including shifting production of some models to Sweden to avoid a levy on Chinese-made vehicles. Mr. Samuelsson said that an I.P.O. was still in the cards â but that there was â no hurry.â
U.S. and E.U. officials are to meet today in Brussels in a bid to avert an all-out trade war. Hereâs what to expect, from 
Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, and Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, are trying to reach an agreement on a plan to cut tariffs on industrial goods to zero and prevent President Trump from carrying out a threat to impose 25 percent levies on car imports. An accord is unlikely on Monday, but businesses on both sides of the Atlantic will be looking for signs that the two sides are making progress.
A German court will start hearing evidence today in a lawsuit filed by Volkswagen shareholders over the carmakerâs emissions-testing scandal. The plaintiffs say that Volkswagen violated its responsibility to them when it used illegal software to cheat on emissions tests â and theyâre seeking billions of euros in damages.
Bankrolling one set of shareholders is the hedge fund Elliott Management. As 
A victory may make amends for Elliottâs failed bet in 2008 against Volkswagen shares. The hedge fund has claimed that market manipulation was to blame in that case, but courts never agreed.
The prices of pork, gasoline and more are rising in China. Government officials said today that an index of consumer prices rose in August for the third consecutive month. 
Higher prices would mean Chinaâs leaders would have to be careful as they seek ways to bolster slowing growth, lest their efforts drive up prices still further. The trade war with the United States could also lead to higher prices for Chinese consumers and companies as tariffs raise the cost of imported goods.
Chinese economists say that there is no cause for alarm, and that some price increases may be temporary. But the consumer price index may understate the situation, so expect close scrutiny of prices over the coming weeks.
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube come under fire every day over disinformation, harassment and more. But you can rely on Pinterest for cutesy design inspiration without fear of fake news. As 
Some investors and employees have said that the approach has stunted growth. But the company is worth $12.3 billion, its user base is expanding and there is wide speculation that it will go public next year. Which side is correct? As Ms. Griffith writes:
If Pinterest continues its trajectory, it could change the narrative of what it takes to build a successful company in Silicon Valley, a meaningful feat at a time that the start-up world is seeking new templates for leaders. If it doesnât, itâll serve as another example of wasted potential, or worse, a cautionary tale.

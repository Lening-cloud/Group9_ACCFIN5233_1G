BEIJING — Theresa May on Wednesday joined a succession of British prime ministers who have turned to China for trade, investment and a shot of confidence, while offering Britain as a reliable, competitive base in Europe.
But her three-day trip to China, shadowed by uncertainties about Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union as well as Mrs. May’s hold on power, has the makings of a long march.
Before her arrival on Wednesday, Mrs. May said the trip would “
In the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing, Mrs. May told China’s premier, Li Keqiang, that they should seek to “build further on that golden era and on the global strategic partnership that we have been working on between the U.K. and China.”
Mr. Li responded with equally effusive rhetoric.
But while Chinese leaders seemed unlikely to publicly air any misgivings over Brexit, as Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc is known, or about Mrs. May’s ability to deliver on commitments, experts said such worries would cloud her visit and limit its results.
“This is the first visit by the British leader since the Brexit referendum, and for both sides the primary aspect is reaffirming the status of that Sino-British ‘golden era,’” said 
“Sino-British trade has felt some impact from Brexit,” Mr. Cui said. “We’ll see whether this time there can be better communication to resolve some problems.”
Mrs. May’s own political fate is also weighing on the visit. On her flight to her first stop in China, Wuhan, an industrial city on the Yangtze River, she was peppered with reporters’ questions about 
“I‘m not a quitter and there is a long-term job to be done,” she said, 
China, the world’s second-biggest economy, could become a more important source of customers and investment for Britain as its scheduled March 2019 departure from the European Union looms. After her meetings in Beijing, including with Mr. Xi, Mrs. May will visit Shanghai to promote trade and investment.
In 2016, China was the destination 
In a press appearance with Mr. Li, Mrs. May said that she had won China’s agreement to take steps toward lifting a ban on British beef imports, which dated back to the crisis over mad cow disease during the 1990s.
But China also bristles with policies and practices that protect many domestic industries from foreign competitors, and Mrs. May has sounded a more guarded note about prospects for cooperation than did Mr. Cameron and his Labour Party predecessors, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair.
Mr. Cameron and George Osborne, the former chancellor of the Exchequer, courted Chinese investment aggressively, placing less emphasis on contentious issues like democracy, human rights and the future of Hong Kong, a former British colony. In 2015, Britain also bucked the United States by joining China’s fledgling 
But Mrs. May, who took office in 2016, has taken a cooler approach to Beijing, delaying for several months a decision to 
“It was a very marked shift from the moment she came to power,” said 
Chinese interest in investing in some sectors of the British economy, like infrastructure, technology and even financial services in London, probably will not be seriously dampened by Britain’s departure from the European Union, said 
But in other sectors, Chinese companies’ willingness to invest could depend greatly on the terms of Britain’s new relationship with Europe, he said.
In theory, after it leaves the bloc, Britain “could design a relationship with China that could move away from the model currently being put forward in the E.U.-China relationship,” Dr. Irwin Crookes said by email. But in practice, the European Union may demand that Britain avoid policies that undercut European trade positions, he said.
“This then is also a matter of high politics, and it is unclear in what direction it could move,” Dr. Irwin Crookes said.
This is not Mrs. May’s first visit to China; she and Mr. Xi met during the Group of 20 summit meeting in the eastern city of Hangzhou in 2016. But this time, Mrs. May faces the dilemma of whether to endorse Mr. Xi’s “
That project has unsettled some American and European policymakers, who worry it will be a vehicle for one-sided Chinese influence and interests. Britain has been cautious, but Mr. Xi has made it one of his signature international undertakings. Mrs. May said in Beijing that Britain would work with China on deciding how to cooperate on the initiative, while ensuring that it “meets international standards.”
“Obviously, China knows that Britain is pretty desperate for trade deals, so maybe she’s trying to generate a bit of leverage of her own,” said Dr. Foot of Oxford. “Secondly, there’s a genuine concern that involvement in ‘Belt and Road’ is not going to be open, essentially, to other companies and to other countries.”
Mrs. May has also been pushed to raise what Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, called “increasing threats to basic freedoms” in the city, which Britain returned to China in 1997 under a promise that Beijing would let it keep its civil liberties and legal autonomy for 50 years. Mr. Xi’s government has tightened its grip on Hong Kong politics, publishing and news media, especially since the 
In a letter to Mrs. May this week, Mr. Patten and Paddy Ashdown, former leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, 
“It’s been very difficult to build up a broad base of interest in the subtle changes that have been going on in Hong Kong,” Dr. Foot said. “It’s a long time since the handover of 1997, so it’s been very difficult against the weight of China’s economic and political prominence.”

The Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires this weekend gave finance ministers a chance to compromise over trade. They didnât. Steven Mnuchin, the U.S. treasury secretary, dismissed concerns from the International Monetary Fund that tariff wars might hurt America through a global slowdown. Friction, Alan Rappeport of the NYT writes, is 
Not helping:

Mr. Marchionne revived an automaker that many people thought was doomed. But the company 
So what can Mr. Manley do? Maybe sell up, the 
Itâs possible that Manley will decide that the best way to deal with all these challenges is to pursue a merger with a peer â as Marchionne tried and failed to do with G.M. Marchionneâs assessment in his 2015 âConfessions of a Capital Junkieâ remains correct: it is madness for automakers to each spend heavily developing near identical technologies, when sharing the burden would be more efficient.
A full year before last weekâs record fine over Android smartphone deals, the search giant was quietly seeking a settlement with Margrethe Vestager, the E.Uâs competition commissioner.

The Silicon Valley search giant had waited at least a year too long to broach the subject of a settlement, the 50-year-old Vestager said in an interview. When a company wants to settle, it needs to âreach out immediately afterâ getting the E.U.âs initial complaint or statement of objections. âThat didnât happen in this case and then of course it takes the route that it has now taken,â Vestager said of the settlement talks, which havenât been previously reported. âSo no surprises.â
The 2010 Dodd-Frank law was supposed to make derivatives â the financial instruments that helped cause the 2008 crisis â easier to regulate. But Emily Flitter of the NYT reports that itâs also 
Banks donât have to disclose to American regulators their holdings of derivatives housed in certain offshore entities. The critical variable is whether the American parent company is legally on the hook to bail out its foreign subsidiary if it gets into trouble. As long as the answer is no, the foreign entity isnât subject to the Dodd-Frank requirements.
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all appear to use the loophole â though mostly only for a fraction of their derivatives trading.
The electric car company has always spent fast. But it has a new short-term idea to deal with that. To judge by a memo reviewed by the WSJ, itâs 
The automakerâs memo, sent by a global supply manager, described the request as essential to Teslaâs continued operation and characterized it as an investment in the car company to continue the long-term growth between both players.
Tesla reportedly requested a âmeaningfulâ amount of money, though itâs unclear from how many companies.
Was that wise? Dennis Virag, a manufacturing consultant, told the WSJ that big refunds could hurt suppliers enough to risk parts problems.

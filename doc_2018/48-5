Saudi Arabiaâs investment conference opened today, with another big-name speaker taken off its agenda: 
Mr. Son had been one of few big-name speakers still scheduled to attend the Future Investment Initiative event, after numerous high-profile C.E.O.s and politicians canceled amid concerns over the death of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Mr. Son is in a 
It appears that after weeks of internal deliberations, Mr. Son decided that snubbing the Saudis was the best course of action. An executive from the Vision Fund spoke at the conference as scheduled, 
Many of those attending the Saudi conference will try to keep a low profile. One piece of advice from a banker who

The firm is already the worldâs biggest money manager, with more than $6 trillion under management. But its C.E.O., Larry Fink, says that the future of investment 
Mr. Fink isnât the first Wall Street executive to promote the idea. But the power of BlackRock could help this approach catch on. Today alone, the firm unveiled seven new ESG funds in the U.S. and Europe.
And the firm has grand ambitions. Mark Wiedman, the head of its iShares unit, told the FT: âOne day weâll drop âsustainableâ because this lineup will just be the core of all great portfolios.â
At 91, Paul Volcker has seen plenty of highs and lows in the U.S. But the former Fed chairman, whose memoir comes out this month, 
Looser regulations on banks may help usher in the next financial crisis, he says. Americans have little respect for the presidency, the Supreme Court or Congress. But Mr. Volckerâs biggest complaint is about the influence of money on how the country is run:
âThe central issue is, weâre developing into a plutocracy,â he told me. âWeâve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that theyâre rich because theyâre smart and constructive. And they donât like government, and they donât like to pay taxes.â
The Information Technology Industry Council, which counts Google and Facebook as members, has published 
â¢ âIndividuals should be informed about the collection and use of their personal data in a fashion that is meaningful, clear, conspicuous and useful to the individual.â
â¢ âIndividuals should have the right to exercise control over the use of their personal data where reasonable to the context surrounding the use of personal data.â
â¢ âCompanies should identify, monitor, and document uses of data they know to be personal and ensure that all identified uses of that personal data are legitimate.â
None of this is revolutionary, but the six-page document dives into more detail than many similar proposals. Thatâs not surprising: Lawmakers are still in the early stages of figuring out what new privacy rules should look like, so industry groups are doing what they can now to shape their thinking.
The U.S. labor market is in its best shape in decades, with unemployment averaging about 4 percent this year. But wage growth has stagnated, puzzling economists.
Ernie Tedeschi of the research business Evercore ISI 
â¢ More slack in the labor market could mean that the economy can support more work than is actually being created.
â¢ A slowdown in productivity gains, so that the value of what workers produce is growing more slowly than in the past.
â¢ Rising inequality, which could reduce upward mobility and weaken the bargaining power of unions to negotiate raises.
Mr. Tedeschiâs conclusion: âAlthough the unemployment rate may look the way it did in boom times in 2000, for many Americans, wage growth has much further to go.â
The Trump administration wants NASA to focus on ambitious challenges like sending astronauts to Mars. Some of the money to make that happen is supposed to come from handing off parts of space exploration to the private sector. The federal government, for instance, plans to cut direct financing of the International Space Station after 2024.
But 
Companies like Bigelow are years from launching their space stations, and such expensive, cutting-edge projects often slip behind schedule. Critics worry that the International Space Station might be discarded before its successors are ready. A gap without space stations would disrupt NASAâs studies, as well as emerging commercial endeavors. Nouveau space station companies could go belly up if the hoped-for customers are slow to show up.

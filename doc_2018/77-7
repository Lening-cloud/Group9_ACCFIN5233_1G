Small- and medium-sized banks stand to get the most relief from

This change provides a big opening to officials at the Fed who are eager to deregulate. They could decide to perform the tests, say, every two years, or allow for an even longer break. During the untested period, the banks could grow complacent about risks. Crucially, the stress tests also help determine a bank’s level of capital, its main defense against losses. As a result, banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets could let their capital levels decline during the untested period, leaving them less protected against losses. With more than $2 trillion in combined assets, the banks could report large losses in a future crisis.
The nation’s largest banks, those with more than $250 billion in assets, also get a stress test concession under the new legislation. Dodd-Frank required these banks (and others) to apply their own stress tests to their balance sheets at least once a year, but the new law allows the Fed to demand these tests “periodically.” These bank-run tests have allowed regulators to assess the quality of the largest banks’ risk management. If the Fed requires these company tests less frequently, regulators may end up with less insight into how the most systemically important banks are preparing for shocks.
There are a couple of reasons Wall Street is taking note of 
• He is leaving Penney at a crucial time for brick-and-mortar retailers, particularly department stores. The company has failed to turn itself around for years under a succession of C.E.O.s, from the former Apple retail chief Ron Johnson to Mike Ullman to Mr. Ellison himself. Shares in Penney have fallen some 87 percent over the past five years and tumbled again on Tuesday amid questions about the retailer’s direction. (For now, Mr. Ellison will be

The new flaw will lead to the same problem: Intel says that users could see a 2 percent to 8 percent decrease in performance when updates are installed.
But we’ve been here before. And while the media reaction to the problem in January was huge, the impact on chip-makers was minimal. First-quarter earnings appeared to be unaffected by the security scare: Revenue 
Today, there’s no sign that either company is hurting all that much. AMD’s stock has barely wobbled. And Intel’s appears to have been buoyed by news that it will jointly manufacture new kinds of memory 
Yet both firms still face challenges.
AMD has enjoyed recent success from some of its chips being used to mine cryptocurrency, but more specialized processors from other manufacturers are becoming popular in the Bitcoin community. And Intel still needs to ensure that it cements itself as a major player in A.I. chips, which is becoming harder as companies like Tesla, Apple, Google and Facebook design their own.

From 
To those on Wall Street and other executives who make a living negotiating, the deal struck by the president who wrote “The Art of the Deal” doesn’t look too artful. Not only that, the deal — to the extent there is one — raises all sorts of questions about Mr. Trump’s ability to extract concessions in future negotiations.

“The objective was not to put ZTE out of business. The objective was to make sure that they abide by our sanctions programs.”
Monday’s flurry of deal-making has pushed the value of acquisition announced this year past $2 trillion, the fastest to that level on record, according to Thomson Reuters.
Europe is providing the biggest boost to this year’s record pace. European deal volume stands at $713 billion so far this year. That nearly equals the full year totals hit the past two years for the region.
The biggest European deals announced this year include: Takeda’s $63 billion deal for Shire; E.On’s announced purchase of Innogy for $35 billion, and Comcast $31 billion bid for Sky.

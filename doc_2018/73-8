Speaking to Xinhua, China’s state news agency, Mr. Ma said that his promise “was made on the premise of friendly U.S.-China partnership and rational trade relations.” With Washington and Beijing firmly locked in a trade dispute, those conditions don’t exist.
Mr. Ma isn’t alone in making a U-turn over the trade fight. The Chinese consumer goods company Haier

With the midterms approaching, Facebook has stepped up efforts to root out disinformation and rogue accounts. Samidh Chakrabarti, who leads Facebook’s elections and civic engagement team, says that safeguarding elections from interference is “probably the biggest companywide reorientation since our shift from desktops to mobile phones.”

Once a problem reaches the War Room, the dashboards will be set to spot and track unusual activity, while data scientists and security experts take a closer look. Mr. Chakrabarti said the team was particularly on guard for posts that manifested “real-world harm,” and planned to remove posts that tried to disenfranchise voters by giving incorrect polling data or spreading hoaxes like encouraging people to vote by text message. “The best outcome for us is that nothing happens in the War Room,” he said. “Everything else we are doing is defenses we are putting down to stop this in the first place.”
The Federal Reserve is slowly raising interest rates to prevent the U.S. economy from overheating — a plan President Trump has publicly criticized. The danger of such interference is clear, but Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, has a plan.
Though not a trained economist, Mr. Powell is a veteran Washington operator who appears to be making allies to keep the Fed independent. Here’s more from 
He grew up and earned his law degree there and made a fortune while working at D.C.-based private equity powerhouse Carlyle Group. He has deep connections to Washington’s Republican establishment. He served in the U.S. Department of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s and is a member of the city’s elite Metropolitan Club, located just blocks from the White House.
He also has one trait that may serve him best of all: an ability to explain difficult concepts in a way that people who aren’t pointy-headed economists (i.e., members of Congress) can understand.
There are plenty of financial issues to worry about — private equity debt, emerging market struggles, stocks that seem to ignore trade threats and more. But none appears able to drag down the economy to its knees by itself. Which is why Paul Krugman of the NYT thinks the next slump 
The next slump won’t be a big bang like 2008, it will be a smorgasbord recession like 1990-1, the cumulation of a bunch of medium-sized issues. You might ask why multiple issues should strike at the same time. The answer, in two words, is Hyman Minsky: after a long period of stable growth, lenders and investors get complacent, and the private sector overreaches. If that is what happens, we should expect another sluggish, jobless recovery like that after the 1990-1 and 2001 recessions, except probably worse.

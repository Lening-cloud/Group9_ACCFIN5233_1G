â¢ Prince Harry, 33, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, married Meghan Markle, 36, an American actress, at Windsor Castle.
â¢ Each has a new title. Harry is now the Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. 
â¢ In the scheme of things, this particular marriage is not all that important. Harry is only sixth in line to the throne. But

It was a long morning of anticipation, nervousness and expectation. Weddings are always fraught, even if they are not your own, and especially when they are as public and imbued with metaphor and meaning as this one.
They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.)
It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghanâs mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud.
It somehow looked charming and just right.
The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring.
There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mÃ©lange including the archbishop of Canterbury and â in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places â the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry.
Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life.
His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harryâs aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harryâs life since his motherâs death had finally lifted.
It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: âArise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.â
It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train.
It was Meghan Markleâs wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped.
This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markleâs own independence.
At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job).

Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. But love is not only about a young couple. Now, the power of love is demonstrated by the fact that weâre all here. Love your neighbor as yourself. If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall, or the mountains should crumble to the sea. Stand by me, stand by me. Stand by me ... I now invite you to join hands and make your vows. â For better or for worse. â For better or for worse. â For richer, for poorer. â For richer, for poorer. â In sickness and in health â In sickness and in health. â To love and to cherish. â To love and to cherish. I therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife. This little light of mine, Iâm going to let it shine. This little light of mine, Iâm going to let it shine. Let it shine, let it shine â¦
The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations.
And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Kellerâs name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue.
The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedmanâs reaction 
Unlike a lot of weddings â and certainly unlike Kate and Williamâs wedding, just seven years ago â the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. Itâs a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.)
Kate and Williamâs wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good.
But this looked totally fun for the guests â even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards â because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters.
Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years.
Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because itâs fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.)
This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration.
One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harryâs list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. Georgeâs Chapel.
It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers. If anyone qualifies as American royalty, it is surely Oprah, with her ability to transcend race and background, and her great gift for openness and emotional candor.
Kate Middletonâs parents, Carole and Michael, were there. They have always done such a good job of wearing appropriate outfits, smiling tastefully and saying nothing.
There was Charles Spencer, the Earl of Althorp, Dianaâs brother, perhaps known best for his active love life and his impassioned attack on the British media after his sisterâs death.
It turned into Celebrity Central. George and Amal Clooney made their stately, Hollywood-y entrance (She was in yellow with an interesting train).
David and Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh and Becks, came in and graced some people in the crowd with their conversation.
For many people, the most striking thing was the sermon by the charismatic Bishop Curry, who preached a ringing message of love â with references to Martin Luther King Jr. and to the legacy of American slavery â with such joy and such enthusiasm that it was impossible not to feel joyful and enthusiastic right alongside him.
âSet me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is as strong as death; passion as fierce as the grave. Itâs flashes of fire, of raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it out.â
It was as if a Southern Baptist preacher had suddenly wandered onto the set of âDownton Abbey.â
The speech began trending on Twitter, with people marveling at the spectacle of seeing such a man saying such things in such a place.
While reporters in the British press corps struggled to render the bishopâs remark that âwe gotta get yâall marriedâ (the BBC rendered it âyou allâ), they also pronounced themselves thrilled â and in a completely unironic way, which does not always come naturally to them.
âIf Pippa was the unexpected star of Kateâs wedding, Michael Curry is the star of this one,â tweeted 
Monica Drake, an assistant managing editor at The Times, writes that 
Stephen Castle, who usually writes about Brexit and other serious matters but today has been promoted to matrimonial correspondent, based in Windsor, met two San Franciscans, Aaron Endre and Alex Conlon, dressed in wigs and white dresses.
âI have had a crush on Harry my entire life, and this is my last-ditch effort to get him,â declared Mr. Endre, who described himself as a gay activist and performer. He was almost entirely kidding.
âHarry, what does it take?â he asked.
Different people had different reasons for coming.
Denise Crawford, who was raised in Jamaica, traveled from her home in Brooklyn to attend a wedding she considered a historic event.
âOne of the children of slaves is marrying a royal whose forerunners sanctioned slavery,â she said. âThe lion is lying down with the lamb.â
Alexa Koppenberg had come from Germany because she didnât trust her web browser. It crashed when she watched the 2011 wedding of William and Kate.
âI think itâs great that sheâs half African-American,â she said of Meghan Markle. âI never thought it would happen, as Harry always dated blondes before.â
Red carpet coverage for awards shows, particularly the Oscars, is strained, frequently sexist and often cringe-worthy â yet it persists. But if the varied and even decent live coverage of the royal wedding has anything to teach us, itâs that moving off the red carpet is the way to go.
Three hours of breathless coverage before an event even starts is â¦ a lot.
Starting at 4 a.m. Eastern, every major outlet and several minor ones began broadcasting, but because no one was interviewing the actual high-profile guests, there was a lot less fawning.
Instead, the BBC broadcast had a brief discussion of the value of poetry with George the Poet (who, yes, is a poet). There were explanations of heraldic iconography, and interviews with people who run charities supported by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
The American networks were also largely genial, discussing floral design, Princess Diana, naves and what defines a âmorning suit.â Everyone gushed about celebrity guests and Oprahâs early arrival.
Talking about fashion is fun and interesting when the people talking about it are fashion experts, not just celebrities. If thereâs a lesson here, itâs this: The shift to a color commentary model, from the current locker-room interview one, is something all red-carpet coverage should embrace.

That was in addition to the thousands of police officers, some on horses, with their sniffer dogs, their metal fencing, their vehicle recognition technology, their closed-circuit TV cameras, their helicopters and their marine patrols of the river.
Windsor was no place to fly a drone, either. The police designated the area an exclusion zone for low-flying traffic on Saturday.
More than 100,000 people were crowded into the little town today. No one is saying how much the security operation cost, but the current (unconfirmed) estimate is that it will come to as much as 30 million pounds.
Thatâs about $40 million, with the bill to be paid by British taxpayers.

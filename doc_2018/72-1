The strategy has risks. Alex Stevenson of the NYT notes that if China is seen as increasingly inhospitable to business, its already struggling economy could suffer more. (Beijing announced yesterday that 
As Fred Hu, the chairman of the investment firm Primavera Capital Group, told the NYT, “China is trying to cultivate ties with” American business giants. It may not be able to have it both ways.
As calls to break up social media companies like Facebook grow, the entrepreneur and investor writes (on LinkedIn, the social network he co-founded) that 
It’s not Facebook’s size that caused the issues. Size makes a platform attractive to hackers, but it also gives that platform more resources to defend itself. If there were, say, five smaller social networks in place of Facebook, that would probably make the situation far worse, because each would be more vulnerable to attack, and when serious problems arose, it would be harder to track down the bad behavior and figure out how to thwart it.
Instead, he argues that there’s a bigger problem: “We haven’t agreed on a set of goals for how social media should impact civil society.” Before we rush to tear up Facebook, he writes, we should work out if social media can be changed to improve society — as happened to newspapers, radio and TV — by demanding more from the companies.
Mr. Hoffman concedes, though, that his approach would mean “a long and never-ending process.”
The American economists William Nordhaus and Paul Romer won the Nobel in economic science this morning. More from 
Mr. Nordhaus was cited for his work on the implications of environmental factors, including climate change. Mr. Romer was cited for his work on the importance of technological change.
It’s all about market failure. Left alone, markets will generate too much pollution (Nordhaus) and too few ideas (Romer).
Avoiding global warming is expensive. Dealing with the damage that it causes could be financially ruinous.

To avoid that fate, the report urges huge transformations of the world economy in the next few years. That means taxing carbon dioxide emissions (perhaps as high as $27,000 per ton by 2100), investments in clean energy (of $2.4 trillion every year through 2035), and a complete end of coal use by 2050.
But such swift and unified change is politically unlikely, especially with President Trump intending to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.
High finance traditionally donates to Republicans over Democrats, with the G.O.P. having outraised its rival by more than $50 million over each of the last three election cycles. This year is proving to be different, according to the NYT: 
Traditional Republican donors like Paul Singer are still giving money to the party, but others have broken rank. Seth Klarman, the hedge fund billionaire, plans to give $20 million to Democrats. Other financiers are backing obscure Democratic candidates for Congress.
Some of Wall Street’s Democratic supporters say they’re driven by opposition to President Trump. Others see something else at work: “They just want to follow winners,” the conservative economist Stephen Moore told the NYT.
Workers at companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce are rebelling. Concerns about their employers’ government work are prompting them to question their bosses — and 
Take Jack Poulson, a research scientist alarmed by Google’s efforts to build a censored search engine for China. He took his concerns to Jeff Dean, the tech giant’s head of A.I. What happened, according to Kate Conger and Cade Metz of the NYT:
According to Dr. Poulson, Mr. Dean said that Google complied with surveillance requests from the federal government and asked rhetorically if the company should leave the United States market in protest. Mr. Dean also shared a draft of a company email that read, “We won’t and shouldn’t provide 100 percent transparency to every Googler, to respect our commitments to customer confidentiality and giving our product teams the freedom to innovate.”
The next day, Dr. Poulson quit.
It may be hard for these tech giants to find replacements, as well. The NYT added that some students are asking similar questions — before they even join the work force.

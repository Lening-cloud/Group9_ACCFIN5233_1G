The iPhone maker said it plans to make a $350 billion contribution to the American economy over the next five years. Some of its new investments will come from bringing back the vast majority of the $252 billion in cash that it has long held abroad.
Under the new tax law, foreign earnings sitting offshore would be considered to be automatically repatriated and taxed at reduced rates.

Google, Amazon and Facebook arenât like the Standard Oil or AT&T of old, gouging consumers on price. (Indeed, many of their services are free.) But if the question is âAre consumers better off?â then could there be an opening for regulatory action?

If market dominance means fewer competitors and less innovation, consumers will be worse off than if those companies had been restrained. âThe impact on innovation can be the most important competitive effectâ in an antitrust case, says Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale University economist who served in the Justice Departmentâs Antitrust Division under Barack Obama.
Goldman 
This morning it posted a quarterly loss in part because of the poor performance in its trading unit.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan unsealed an indictment charging Nicolas De-Meyer, 40, with stealing $1.2 million worth of rare wine from a former employer. The former employer in question was Mr. Solomon, who employed Mr. De-Meyer as a personal assistant, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
According to the indictment, the wine was stolen from around October 2014 to around October 2016, when Mr. De-Meyer had been asked to transport it from his former employerâs Manhattan apartment to his wine cellar in East Hampton, N.Y.
Mr. De-Meyer was arrested in Los Angeles on Tuesday, according to a spokesman for the Los Angeles federal prosecutorâs office. He could not immediately be reached for comment.
âThe theft was discovered in the fall of 2016 and reported to law enforcement at that time,â a Goldman spokesman said.

âThe good news is that tax reform has produced both current and future benefits for our shareholders,â PNCâs president and chief executive, Bill Demchak, told analysts on Friday. He said the bankâs preference would be to divert the tax savings âtoward dividendâ â which is to say, to return a higher dividend to shareholders.
The conglomerate itself isnât planning on going that far just yet.

âWe are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses.

More from Jonathan Randles and Peg Brickley of the WSJ:
A Chapter 11 filing would halt lawsuits brought by women against the studio, forcing them to line up with low-ranking creditors to await their fate. Once the money from a sale comes in, bankruptcy law dictates who gets paid first â the banks that kept Weinstein Co. in business â and who gets paid last â women claiming that Weinstein Co. was part of Mr. Weinsteinâs pattern of alleged sexual misconduct.
But itâs complicated. A bankruptcy filing could provide legal structures for Mr. Weinsteinâs accusers, like a judgeâs supervision of sales and settlements.
RICO lawsuits are tempting. They allow a plaintiff to sue a variety of defendants by claiming that they acted together and seek an award of triple damages, a bonanza in some business disputes that can run into millions of dollars. But these cases should also come with a bright red warning sign: Tread lightly or see your case thrown out of court before it even gets started.

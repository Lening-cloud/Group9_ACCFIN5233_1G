âItâs been a difficult time,â he said yesterday. âThereâs been anger and frustration within the company. We all feel it. I feel it too. At Google, we set a very high bar, and we clearly didnât live up to our expectations.â
The company gave male executives accused of sexual misconduct millions of dollars in exit packages, according to an 
But, he added, âmoments like this show we didnât always do it right.â He promised that âthere are concrete steps coming up,â but hesitated to say that Google had a toxic culture. âSexual harassment is a societal problem and Google is a large company,â he said. âWe are definitely doing our best.â
The elder son of Rupert Murdoch was 
Making a rare public appearance yesterday at the conference, Mr. Murdoch 
âI never thought weâd sell the TV studio, the film studio, so who knows?â Mr. Murdoch responded. In the next breath, he said of his father: âHe loves journalism. He loves The Wall Street Journal and what it represents.â

Padma Lakshmi believes in redemption for men brought down in the #MeToo era.
But that redemption should come from genuine remorse over the impact of oneâs actions, Ms. Lakshmi, the host and an executive producer of âTop Chef,â said yesterday â and shouldnât be driven by a manâs being good at a job. â

He was responding to a question about federal criminal charges filed hours earlier 
âIn this case, at the very least, and this part I know, one of our people lied to us and evaded our systems and our controls,â Mr. Blankfein said. âItâs not good.â
For someone who speaks often and loudly about taking a stand and doing good, Larry Fink of BlackRock spends a lot of time thinking about gray areas.
Mr. Fink, the founder, chairman and C.E.O. of the worldâs largest asset manager, said that dropping out of Saudi Arabiaâs big investment conference last month was a âhard decision.â So was the choice earlier this year to offer investment options stripped of stocks in gun manufacturers and retailers.

âWeâre on track, with our rate of learning, to be able to do that next year,â Ms. Barra said. The vehicles can currently run safely at speeds of up to about 30 miles per hour, and the service will be limited to a small geographical area, she added.
Ms. Barra did not say where the service would operate, but noted that the company had been testing in San Francisco.
How often does a tweet, a policy action or a statement by President Trump leave Peter Thiel in disbelief? â
By many measures, Mr. Thiel has impeccable Silicon Valley credentials. But his frequent defense of Mr. Trump has set him apart from much of the tech industry.
At the conference yesterday, he acknowledged that the current political environment was ânot healthy,â but said that the country had been âpolarized since the late â60sâ and that Mr. Trump was ânot the main cause.â

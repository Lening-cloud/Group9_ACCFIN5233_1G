A penalty is expected in the Android case, but its size is unclear. The commission is empowered to impose fines of up to $11bn â which is 10 percent of the global turnover of Googleâs parent company Alphabet â but typically decisions are at the lower end of the range.
The decision will mark an escalation of the commissionâs battle with Google, which began eight years ago with an investigation into comparison shopping, then only a narrow part of online commerce. Though that case concluded with a â¬2.4bn fine, it has not led to significant changes to Googleâs business.
As the FT notes, this penalty could have big ramifications for Google. Its Android operating system dominated smartphone market worldwide because Google gave it away for free. But Ms. Vestager has been looking into whether the Silicon Valley behemoth improperly forced phone makers to favor services like Chrome and Google search, as well as stopping others from developing competing operating systems using the open-source parts of Android.
Google has been in the sights of the E.U. for some time. Last year, Ms. Vestagerâs commission levied

Athenahealth acknowledged that this was possible. From a statement by its executive chairman, Jeff Immelt, on Wednesday:
To ensure athenahealth maximizes shareholder value and is best positioned to realize the full potential of its premier health care technology platform, the board has authorized a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger or continuing as an independent company under new leadership.
Over the past two weeks, Mr. Bush (Athenahealthâs co-founder, and a cousin of George W. Bush) had taken fire for a variety of disclosures about his conduct, both at the workplace and at home.

In an unusual statement on Wednesday, Mr. Bush said of his exit:
âI believe that working for something larger than yourself is the greatest thing a human can do. A family, a cause, a company, a country â these things give shape and purpose to an otherwise mechanical and brief human existence. athenahealth is a near once in a life time example of such a thing. With that lens on, itâs easy for me to see that the very things that made me useful to the company and cause in these past twenty-one years, are now exactly the things that are in the way. I cannot imagine a single organization more loaded with potential to transform health care.â
Athenahealth has the investment banks Lazard and Centerview Partners and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges advising it on a potential sale.
In the meantime, Mr. Immelt â the former G.E. chief who 
From a spokesman:
âElliott welcomes the Boardâs decision to explore strategic alternatives and believes it is the right one for athenahealthâs shareholders, employees and customers. We have long believed that athenahealth is a great company, and we look forward to participating as a bidder in the companyâs strategic exploration process.â
Members of the British governmentâs digital, culture, media, and sports committee tried to catch him out with questions about a series of media reports on Cambridge Analytica, but they didnât seem to unsettle the ex-C.E.O.
Things didnât start well for Mr. Nix. He argued with Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, about whether he was allowed to give an opening statement to provide âfew clarificationsâ about what happened when he last testified before the same panel. He wasnât.
Here are some choice interactions from the rest of the hearing:
Did Mr. Nix take $8 million from the consulting firm before it collapsed, 
âThe allegation is false, the facts are not correct.â
What about reports that 
âThose boxes were not ours. As far as Iâm aware, the I.C.O. were the only people to remove documents, files and hardware from that office.â
Did Cambridge Analytica techniques such as bribery, honey traps and extortion to help nations win elections, as Mr. Nix claimed in 
âI didnât represent the company properly, I didnât represent what we do. In our overzealousness to secure a contract, Mark Turnbull and I were guilty of hyperbole of agreeing on matters that, not only had we never done, but we had no understanding of. We were telling a client what we thought he wanted to hear.â
Did Mr. Nix mean to mislead the politicians during his last hearing (in February, before the Cambridge Analytica scandal exploded)? Then, one member of the committee asked about Cambridge Analyticaâs possession of data obtained from Global Science Research, which has been originally gathered from Facebook users.
âIt was my firm impression that Mr. Collinsâ questions were about whether we were currently in possession of the dataâ¦ so I answered no.â
âWhen I read the transcript, it became clear that Mr. Collins was also asking whether we had ever held it. Clearly the answer should have been yes. The fact that we received data from G.S.R. was already in the public domain from as early as December 2015, when the Guardian published an article.â
âI also stand by my evidence that we do not work on Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data. That data was given by G.S.R., and subsequently deleted at Facebookâs request.â
How useful was the Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica, which was used to inform the companyâs work in the U.S.?
âThat data was less useful than simply using Facebookâs own advertising algorithms.â

More from Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X. Dance:
Facebook officials said the agreements with the Chinese companies allowed them access similar to what was offered to BlackBerry, which could retrieve detailed information on both device users and all of their friends â including religious and political leanings, work and education history and relationship status.
According to Facebook, the user data stayed on phones and never reached those companiesâ servers. Lawmakers are irate anyway: Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said that he will âlook forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that.â
Mick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, announced that he was dismissing the bureauâs consumer advisory board, which provides feedback on its rules and policies.
By law, the bureau must convene the advisory board and hold an in-person meeting with its members at least twice a year. The bureau canceled a meeting scheduled for February, and last week it canceled one planned for this week.
Anthony Welcher, who, as one of Mr. Mulvaneyâs deputies, oversees external affairs for the bureau, told those members of the board, which now numbers 25, that it would be reconstituted as a smaller group.
The consumer advisory boardâs members are consumer activists, academics, entrepreneurs who run financial start-ups and industry representatives from companies including Citi, Discover, and Mastercard.
The White House has said that it plans to help A.I. researchers develop better artificial intelligence systems by making government data available to researchers to help them. But the nation remains at risk of being overtaken as a global A.I. leader, as other nation states appear to value the technology more highly.
Access to high-quality data underpins most of the recent successes in artificial intelligence, as the software is trained to identify patterns by studying huge quantities of historical information, whether its images, text or something else entirely. Now, MIT Technology Review 
âAnything that we can do to unlock government data, weâre committed to. Weâd love to hear from any academic that has any insights.â
Thatâs a small, but nevertheless welcome, promise from an administration that has 
So far, a big part of the administrationâs approach to giving A.I. research a push has focused on removing regulatory barriers so that industry can apply the technology more quickly. It also says that itâs increased investment in R.&D. for âA.I. and related technologiesâ by more than 40 percent since 2015 â though itâs not clear what those ârelated technologiesâ are.
China and Russia have also been outspoken in their desire to be dominant powers in artificial intelligence. In fact, China is already giving America a run for its A.I money: It published more 
Maintaining an edge in artificial intelligence will be incredibly valuable for America. The direct benefits to the economy are huge, if difficult to accurately predict. And the technology is more important than just that, as it will form a huge part of the nationâs military and security operations over the coming years (

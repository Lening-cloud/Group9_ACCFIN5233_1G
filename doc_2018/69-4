But did Comcast overpay for the privilege?

Here’s Andrew’s take on how Brian Roberts, the C.E.O. of Comcast, played the situation:
Mr. Robert’s maneuverings could one day prove to be a case study in tactical deal making. His move to buy most of Fox forced Disney to raise its bid for those assets so much that when it came time to compete for Sky, Disney had a hard time bidding against Comcast without overleveraging itself. Time will tell whether the Sky deal proves successful — but if scored simply on the dark arts of deal making, Mr. Roberts already won.
We’ll see whether Disney ends up selling Fox’s stake in Sky to Comcast. That’s likely, or else Disney risks being a minority owner with little influence. There has also been speculation that Comcast could sell its stake in Hulu to Disney as part of a swap, but that makes little sense for now.

More from Tripp Mickle and Joe Flint of the WSJ:
Recently, Apple initially expressed interest when it was pitched a politically charged show about a college ombudsman in the era of #MeToo, featuring comedian Whitney Cummings and the producer behind the Fox hit “Empire,” Lee Daniels. Apple subsequently sent word there was concern about the sensitive topics, and the sides had differing opinions on the show’s direction.
The show is now in talks to end up at Amazon.
Chinese companies were early to lock up natural resources in Africa. But businesses from other non-Western countries, from Turkey to India, now hope to stake claims.

“It gives Africans much more room to maneuver,” he says. “The level of ambition from leaders has gone up very much in response to these incentives to do more with infrastructure and financing and to dare defy western pressure. They are finding it very exciting.”
The U.S. and Europe are spooked. Their influence has slipped in Africa in recent years, and now they are again scrambling to catch up.

• Amazon Basics? “Literally every clothing department/retailer starts off carrying big-name brands,” he explains. “They watch the data, see what moves, then head to clothing mills and start the journey of house brands.”
• Promoting products via search ranking? That’s plain old advertising.
“What we’re seeing in Amazon is innovation for sure,” Mr. Sinofsky writes. “But it is on a trajectory that retail has seemingly followed every generation.”

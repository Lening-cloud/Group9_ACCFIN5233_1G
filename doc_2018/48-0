And Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber said he wouldn’t attend a conference in Saudi Arabia known as Davos in the Desert later this month. “Unless a substantially different set of facts emerges, I won’t be attending,” he said in a statement. It’s a notable show of leadership, given that the country’s sovereign wealth fund is a major investor in Uber and sits on its board.
Others calling off appearances at the conference:
• Bob Bakish of Viacom
• Steve Case, the AOL co-founder
• Media organizations, including the NYT, The Economist and the LA Times. Andrew, who also canceled his attendance, tweeted that he was “
Other corporate leaders plan to walk a fine line. Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase still plan to attend the Saudi conference this month, and some lobbying firms may keep working for the kingdom.

The social network has taken down 559 pages and 251 accounts — most of which originated in the U.S. — because they were spreading false or misleading political content ahead of the midterm elections. Among them were the page Right Wing News and left-wing outfits like Reverb Press.

Facebook said this amounted to the most domestic pages and accounts it had ever removed related to influence campaigns. The company said it had discovered the activity as part of its broader effort to root out election interference. Also, the pages had become more aggressive in using tactics like fake accounts and multiple pages to make themselves appear more popular.
Facebook said that the removed content violated its rules about online spam, and that it was likely making money for its publishers via ads. “Today, sensational political content seems to be a more effective way for people to build an audience for their pages and drive traffic to their websites, which earn them money for every visitor to the site,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of security.

A weaker renminbi has made Chinese goods more attractive despite the tariffs. But the surge may have been spurred by a rush of shipments from China before a wave of tariffs went into effect on Sept. 24. Even if Chinese exports fall in October, expect Mr. Trump to be displeased.
President Trump has suggested that American companies should report earnings twice a year instead of four times. The head of the S.E.C. says that’s not likely, at least not anytime soon.
Jay Clayton, the commission’s chairman, said at an event in Washington yesterday that big companies would 
But he added that he understands the concern: “The president did touch on a nerve, which is: Are people running their companies too much for the short term in response to pressures?”
The U.S. economy is riding high. But emerging markets are struggling and their troubles could lead to a worldwide recession. That could pose problems, as the global ability to combat a downturn is more limited than ever.
Part of the problem is that interest rates around the world generally remain low, leaving central banks little room to maneuver. The Economist argues that 
Unprecedented cross-border cooperation was needed to fend off the crisis in 2008. But the rise of populists will complicate the task of working together. The Fed’s swap lines with other central banks, which let them borrow dollars from America, might be a flash point. And falling currencies may feed trade tensions. This week Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, warned China against “competitive devaluations.” Mr. Trump’s belief in the harm caused by trade deficits is mistaken when growth is strong. But when demand is short, protectionism is a more tempting way to stimulate the economy.

• Britain would remain in a temporary customs union with the E.U. with no agreed end date
• Northern Ireland would remain part of the E.U.’s single market for a transition period, avoiding a hard trade barrier in the middle of the Irish landmass.
Several Conservative Party ministers are said to have concerns about the customs union proposal. And Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, a crucial part of Mrs. May’s governing coalition, has long opposed the single market strategy. Expect tense negotiations within the party ahead of meetings with E.U. representatives next week.

As voters head to the polls, employees at Facebook and Twitter will be on high alert. Neither company wants a repeat of 2016, when Russian operatives used their platforms to influence voters.
Both claim to be ready. Twitter now automatically detects suspicious activity, and has been working with the Department of Homeland Security. (âWe are more prepared than we have ever been,â Del Harvey, Twitterâs head of trust and safety

But what happens if there is a big Democratic victory? Analysts appear split on 
Perhaps more than ever, Beijing is interested in how Americans vote. A strong showing by Democrats would weaken President Trump â which could be a boon for China, whose economy is beginning to suffer from American tariffs.
More on that from the scholar Anson Au 
If the Republicans lose their majority in both upper and lower chambers, gone will be the days where Trump does anything he wants. Thereâll be less room for chest-thumping bravado and more need for rational policy making and diplomacy. Trump would have to change his approach to adopt a more moderate tone: where before he could command, he would have to negotiate â with other countries, and within his own.
So much for one HQ2. Amazon is nearing a decision to 
More from Karen Weise and J. David Goodman of the NYT on Amazonâs reasoning:
Picking multiple sites would allow it to tap into two pools of talented labor and perhaps avoid being blamed for all of the housing and traffic woes of dominating a single area. It could also give the company greater leverage in negotiating tax incentives, experts said.
âEven if the most obvious reasons appear to be about attracting more tech workers, the P.R. and government incentives benefits could help, too,â said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the online jobs site.
Amazon already has large operations in both areas, which both have 
But the decision would mean that neither city could really claim to have a campus equal to the one in Seattle, as Amazon originally promised.
High-level talks between Washington and Beijing are being rekindled. First, President Trump held a â
The Chinese vice president, Wang Qishan, said today that China was ready for discussions âon issues of mutual concernâ that could lead to a deal âacceptable to both sides.â He added that âChina and the U.S. will both gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation,â echoing 
But a note of caution: Mr. Trump said on Monday that âif we can make the right deal, a deal thatâs fair, weâll do that. Otherwise we wonât do it.â
He and Mr. Xi are expected to meet at the G-20 summit meeting in Argentina this month.
After intense criticism about the way Facebook was used to incite violence in Myanmar, the company commissioned an independent investigation.
In 
âThe report concludes that, prior to this year, we werenât doing enough to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence. We agree that we can and should do more.â
When 13 American venture capitalists and tech executives visited China in August, 
But Li Yuan of the NYT notes that these Silicon Valley emissaries also found much to worry about:
Chinese technology executives, they found, were even more driven and more willing to do whatever it takes to win. But that comes with major trade-offs, and punishing work schedules are only the beginning. They found Chinese tech executives to be less reflective about the social impact and potential misuse of their technologies, a potentially worrisome quality in a country with loosely enforced privacy laws, strict government censorship and a powerful domestic surveillance apparatus.
Bloomberg Businessweek took a close look at Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and how he has become 
The magazine explains how he assumed a very visible role:
When he tapped Ross in late 2016 for the position, the president-elect called him âa killerâ and promised Ross would be a key adviser in the crusade to throw over the chessboard when it comes to Americaâs trade relationships. âWilburâs at all the meetings,â says Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council. âAll the meetings. Heâs been a big player in the Trump administration.â

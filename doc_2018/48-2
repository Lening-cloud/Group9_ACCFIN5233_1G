The Saudi governmentâs so-called Davos in the Desert investment conference took a serious hit over the past 48 hours when three Wall Street executives withdrew over the disappearance and possible killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 
Their decision gave other executives cover to withdraw. But as the WSJ points out, plenty 
The U.S. governmentâs response so far has been inaction. The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is still 
How a conference known as the Davos in the Desert turned into a crucible for these executives and others demonstrates the curious change the world has seen under a businessman president: Americaâs moral compass being steered by the C-suite, rather than the Oval Office.
The federal governmentâs budget deficit 
The Treasury Department attributed the increase to higher government spending on the military. But that expenditure actually fell as a percentage of the overall (and rapidly growing) economy.
Corporate tax revenues have fallen by a third from a comparable period a year ago, a direct consequence of the tax law signed last year, which reduced the top corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
For the full 2018 fiscal year, corporate tax receipts were nearly $205 billion. That figure is a drop from $297 billion in fiscal year 2017.
And because the tax law change didnât take effect until January, its full effect wonât be known until the 2019 fiscal year.
At a conference yesterday celebrating Wired magazineâs 25th anniversary, two of the biggest names in tech addressed some of their divisive business strategies:

Burmese military officials were behind a systematic campaign on Facebook to incite ethnic cleansing in the country, according to an 
More from Paul Mozur of the NYT:
The military exploited Facebookâs wide reach in Myanmar, where it is so broadly used that many of the countryâs 18 million internet users confuse the Silicon Valley social media platform with the internet. Human rights groups blame the anti-Rohingya propaganda for inciting murders, rapes and the largest forced human migration in recent history.
Facebook has since removed accounts with a total of 1.3 million followers that supposedly focused on entertainment, but that instead appeared tied to the military.
This is the latest in a series of disinformation campaigns â including from Russia and Iran â to plague Facebook. But as Mr. Mozur points out, it is âamong the first examples of an authoritarian governmentâs using the social network against its own people.â
The Microsoft co-founder, who helped popularize personal computing with Bill Gates and later used his wealth to transform Seattle, died yesterday. The cause was complications of non-Hodgkinâs lymphoma, which returned years after he had been treated for it.
Mr. Allen was instrumental in putting together a deal to buy an early operating system from a programmer in Seattle. He and Mr. Gates tweaked and massaged the code, and it became the operating system that guided the IBM personal computer, introduced in 1981. That product, called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was a watershed for the company. Later would come Microsoftâs immensely popular Windows operating system, designed to be used with a computer mouse and onscreen icons.
In a statement, Mr. Gates said that he was âheartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends,â adding that âpersonal computing would not have existed without him.â
In 2013, Carl Icahn fought to stop Michael Dell and the investment firm Silver Lake from taking Dell private. This time, the billionaire investor 
Mr. Icahn said in a letter yesterday that he owns 8.3 percent of a special Dell stock that tracks the companyâs holdings in the publicly traded company VMware. Dell announced this summer that it plans to buy out owners of that stock, known by its ticker symbol, DVMT, for $21.7 billion. The deal would result in Dell becoming a publicly traded company again.
That price, Mr. Icahn argues, is well below DVMTâs fair value and would give Mr. Dell âan economic windfall.â Given the size of Mr. Icahnâs stake, and that other large DVMT shareholders also dislike the buyout plan, Mr. Dell and Silver Lake may be in for

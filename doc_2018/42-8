Earlier yesterday, Sears announced that 
This isn’t surprising. Sears has lost $11 billion since 2011; sales have dropped 60 percent over the same period; and it has closed hundreds of stores. Its C.E.O., Eddie Lampert, has sold off businesses to raise cash, but critics argue that he has strip-mined the company.
Filing for bankruptcy is risky for retailers, as doing so tends to send customers and suppliers fleeing, making it hard to recover. There’s no reason to think Sears would fare any differently.
The nearly $100 billion investment fund is in talks to buy a majority stake in WeWork for at least $15 billion, according to 
That is a huge bet to place on a company with enormous growth, huge ambitions — and widening losses.
SoftBank’s Masa Son often 
Beijing is running out of options in the trade war. One extreme action it could take, as the holder of over $1 trillion in U.S. foreign debt, would be to buy back that debt — or even to dump it on the open market. Experts tend to dismiss that possibility, as it would severely damage both the American and Chinese economies.
But in 
There is no proving ground. There is no predictable math, no scale model. If China were to use its nuclear option and the markets didn’t react, it would lose influence in stark fashion. If it worked — but was more effective than expected — China could inflict unintended damage on its own economy. And even a perfectly executed strike that left China unharmed would be perilous: A targeted attack on the United States economy would have unknowable repercussions. If the fallout cloud settled over Europe or emerging markets, would China be ready for that fight, too?
Beijing’s latest effort to prop up its economy amid a trade war with the U.S. isn’t working yet. China’s currency, the renminbi, fell again this week, to below 6.93 per dollar.
But the currency doesn’t trade freely: It moves within a range set by the central bank. And a fall in its value can make Chinese exports cheaper for foreign buyers, which is handy when President Trump’s tariffs push up their prices in America.
Unsurprisingly, the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says he’s watching closely. “As we look at trade issues, there is no question that we want to make sure China is not doing competitive devaluations,” he 
President Trump has praised the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement as a win for farmers. That may be correct — but many businesses still face challenges as a result of tariffs on steel and aluminum that remain in place. More from 
Among the sectors hardest hit by Mr. Trump’s approach are the beverage and auto industries, which rely heavily on foreign aluminum and steel to make cans and cars. PepsiCo, the drinks and snacks company, said this month that higher prices for aluminum imports from Canada were eating into quarterly profits and said it would raise prices as a result. The company lowered its profit forecast for the year and its stock slid. Similarly, the chief executive of Ford Motor Company said last month that the additional costs from the metal tariffs alone would shave about $1 billion off its annual profits.
The new trade deal won’t be signed until late November, and it could be amended before then. Some Republican lawmakers have been pushing Mr. Trump to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs. That may happen — or the whole thing could be thrown into limbo if Democrats take back the House.
The former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York was an aggressive prosecutor of white-collar crime. But he and Robert Jackson Jr., an S.E.C. commissioner, think that U.S. insider-trading laws 
The uncertainty in insider trading law invites debate over the legality of misconduct that has no place in our markets. But this is a fixable problem: The law can be updated and made clearer. Ideally, Congress would take the lead. But bipartisan proposals to update the law have languished for years. The S.E.C., however, does have the authority to clarify insider trading law. The commission should use that authority before the next wave of corporate abuses.
Mr. Bharara has set up a task force to study the issue and come up with concrete solutions. Then he just needs to persuade Congress to take them up.

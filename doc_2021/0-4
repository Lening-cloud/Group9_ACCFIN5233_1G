But the system introduces new features, like handing out âpointsâ that applicants must accrue to come to Britain. Some are mandatory, like 20 points for a job offer from a government-approved sponsor. Others are optional, such as 10 points for a Ph.D. in a field relevant to the job. The new rules make entry to the country conditional on a migrantâs income (a minimum of Â£25,600 a year, around $35,000, with a few exceptions) and perceived âskills.â Low-paid workers are effectively excluded. Along with making it even harder to safely migrate to Britain, the new system treats migrants as nothing more than disposable commodities.
This dehumanizing, ruthless approach has been on display through the past year. At the start of the pandemic, a

Mr. Johnsonâs government has left immigrants, especially those of color, exposed and vulnerable. But itâs no use denouncing the current system without understanding that it is built on decades of brutality. British history is full of legislation, like the 1968 Commonwealth Immigrants Act, aimed at making it more difficult for people of color to come to the country.
And for decades, British politicians of all persuasions glossed over the reasons people move while wrongly blaming migrants for almost anything they can think of, from low pay to an underfunded national health service. Even the latest proposals draw on the racialized figure of the âbogus asylum seeker,â popularized during former Prime Minister Tony Blairâs New Labour government as it made asylum rules 
Mr. Johnsonâs government is the heir to decades of anti-migrant rhetoric and policymaking. Determined to make good on the nativist promise of Brexit, it is taking things to the next level, with devastating human consequences.
Britain has an immigration problem, all right. But itâs not the people coming to the country. Itâs the people who rule over it.

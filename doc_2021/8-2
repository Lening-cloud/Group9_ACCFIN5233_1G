The word âracismâ actually came into widespread use in English in reference to Nazi attitudes toward Jewish people. Being the victim of prejudice, however, does not inoculate us from our own prejudices. Edward Augustus Freeman, who went on to be Regius professor of history at Oxford, wrote, while visiting America in 1881, that his interlocutors generally agreed with his proposal that âthis would be a grand land if only every Irishman would kill a Negro and be hanged for it.â Yet WASP bigotry toward the Irish immigrants didnât save them from bigotry toward Black people.

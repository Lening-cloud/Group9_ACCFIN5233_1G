Britainâs 
Pro-Brexit politicians and commentators 
With vaccination rates that are a fraction of Britainâs, 
âBoris Johnson is going to have a vaccine dividend, and that will give him a whole new narrative for the summer and beyond,â said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Kent.
Itâs a narrative that seeks to deflect attention from 
Until then, Mr. Johnsonâs government was known mainly for its dilatory and erratic response to the pandemic â tardy lockdowns, frequent policy reversals, muddled public messaging and a hapless test-and-trace system â all of which contributed to Britain having the highest death toll in Europe.
Now, though, the prime ministerâs approval ratings have recovered, powered largely by the publicâs enthusiasm about the vaccine rollout. In 
Mr. Johnsonâs vaccine bounce, analysts point out, could be fleeting if a new variant emerges or if the economy does not recover swiftly.
But Mr. Goodwin said one consequence of the vaccine success is that there are few signs of significant numbers of people rethinking the wisdom of Brexit or suffering the acute regret â or as he called it, âBregretâ â that some expected.

This time last year, Sam Heughan was in Los Angeles promoting the fifth season of his Starz hit âOutlander.â Heughan plays Jamie Fraser, a righteous âking of all menâ archetype and the beloved husband of Claire (CaitrÃ­ona Balfe), in the fantastical period drama, an ode to 18th century Scottish history, culture and diaspora that eventually takes the characters to colonial America.
Like many people in early 2020, Heughan soon found himself stuck in place â as Covid-19 lockdowns went into effect around the world, the Glasgow resident remained in the United States because of uncertainty over gathering and travel safety.
But he was dreaming of Scotland, where he returned after lockdowns eased in the spring. Heughan (pronounced HEW-an) spent much of his time in quarantine remotely collaborating with his former âOutlanderâ co-star and fellow Scot, Graham McTavish, on a book called â
âMen in Kilts,â which premiered this week 
ââOutlanderâ made me realize how much I love Scotland, how much I didnât know about Scotland,â Heughan said. âBut also how much I knew and learned as a child, but wasnât really aware of.â
In a video call last week, Heughan talked about how âMen in Kiltsâ came to life, his passion for all things Scottish and his surprisingly busy pandemic year. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Working on âOutlander,â I saw that people were really interested â as was I â in Scotland and in these Highland characters, especially during Seasons 1 and 2. And then, by chance, I was having a coffee and a beer with Graham McTavish in Los Angeles and he mentioned that he had an idea for a documentary show about Scotland. Two years ago, I just started thinking, why donât we just do it? So while shooting âOutlander,â we managed to organize a crew and some locations and got it all together. We produced a sort of pilot episode that we could pitch to Starz and [Sony Pictures Television, the producing studio], and it progressed from there.
The book is the story of the initial road trip and material we shot before weâd sold the show. We wrote it remotely during lockdown while I was in America and Graham was in New Zealand. It was a really quick process â we started writing it in March and delivered it by summer.
We just touch the surface of it, but for example, the seafood that we have is the best in the world. Even Scottish fruit is amazing. Itâs not just whisky and haggis, though of course we do look at that on the show.
I really just wanted to share my love of Scotland and its landscape, culture and music. Like Ceilidh dancing â Scottish dancing â is just part of my heritage, but people donât know about it. And I wish everyone could go to a Ceilidh because theyâre the best fun ever.
Weâre two almost middle-aged white males trying to prove to the other one that weâve got what it takes, and we really donât. We do get on and thereâs no one else in the world who I like to wind up as much. Our banter or humor is like a dysfunctional married couple.
The process of creating a TV show is very different to what I was used to â to really be in control of the content and the scheduling and the edit. So we were involved along the way and it was really good fun to work with Graham. Difficult, because of different time zones and Covid, but weâre really lucky that we managed to get it all together.
Itâs been strangely busy for me. We went into the lockdown, and I was initially in America, and we were writing the book â I donât know if the book would have happened without the lockdown because I had so much time. Then we were working on âMen in Kiltsâ as well, the preproduction, and after that first lockdown, we went into shooting. Then I went to London, and I shot a movie called âText for You,â with 
Part of me was like, itâd be quite nice to just take a bit of time out. But Iâm so fortunate that weâre working and also making sure that everyone is safe with the Covid protocols.
Itâs not so much the protocols that are difficult â you have to wear a mask, you have to social distance where you can â itâs more the psychology of it. Certainly when you first start a job, everyoneâs very tense, very aware. Of course the protocols are there for your own good, but everyone struggles with feeling like youâre being repressed or not being yourself, or going against your own instincts as a human being. When you see somebody you havenât seen for a while, you want to give them a hug or touch them or get closer to them. Youâre having to go against your instincts as an actor on set, where youâre supposed to use your instincts to portray a character. So it is a really weird situation, but you get used to it.
Iâm pretty private in my personal life. But I was having a lot of problems with scammers, people pretending to be me or my company. So this felt like a way I can say, look, if itâs not verified, itâs not me. So hopefully it should make things clearer. Itâs not something I use much, but occasionally if I want to reach out directly to fans or ask their opinion about something, I can do that. But it is pretty overwhelming, to be honest.
I donât really see anything untoward â there might be the odd one, but I just ignore it. I suppose thatâs surprising, but it goes to show that this fan group is quite unique and very supportive. Even with their response to 
Iâd been approached by a number of distilleries to white label something, and I just didnât want to do that. I wanted to create it myself. So itâs self-financed, and I did a big tour with my business partner in Scotland, tasting lots of whiskey â itâs a hard job.
Sassenach is a Scottish Gaelic word meaning outsider â originally it meant English person, and it was quite derogatory. But âOutlanderâ changed the meaning, and people started calling each other âSassenachâ as a term of endearment. Thatâs what I liked: Itâs about the outsider, and we all feel like outsiders at some point.
Asking an actor about politics is probably never the best thing. The times Iâve mentioned politics or Tweeted or Instagrammed something, and the abuse you get, especially about American politics â people telling me I donât know what Iâm talking about because itâs not my country. But itâs wrong to think that what happens in another country doesnât affect the rest of the world.
Brexit has been a complete mess, complete shambles to my mind, totally ridiculous. This insular kind of jingoism thatâs been going on â I love Britain, and Iâm also proud to be Scottish, but I donât want to be a backward country that thinks itâs better than everyone else. And I also think working with Europe is really important. With my partners, we had a lot of business with Europe, and itâs cost us a lot of money and time just trying to navigate that. Iâm thinking, too, about

LONDON â Prime Minister Boris Johnsonâs decision to 
Mr. Johnson says he would rather Britain leave with a reworked Brexit deal but, failing that, it would be out the door anyway. His opponents have sworn to remove any possibility of leaving without a deal, which they say would be 
Adding to the confusion, what happens next depends not just on the battle between the prime minister and his opponents in Parliament, but also on the flexibility of the so-far unyielding European Union leadership and, down the line, quite possibly on a British court.
Following are six of the most likely outcomes leading up to Oct. 31.
Members of Parliament donât agree about much on 
If they fail to legislate against a no-deal Brexit, lawmakers can resort to the ultimate weapon: a motion of no confidence, ousting Mr. Johnson from office. Currently, they do not appear to have the votes to make this happen. But even if they did, it might not solve the problem.
The law calls for the formation of a new government within two weeks or a general election. One option might be a caretaker administration that would presumably request another Brexit delay to afford time to hold an election. The problem is opposition leaders cannot agree on a caretaker prime minister. Jeremy Corbyn, the natural choice as leader of the Labour Party, is too left-wing, and as a lifelong critic of the European Union, is distrusted by determined opponents of Brexit.
Many would prefer a more centrist figure â perhaps the former Conservative cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke â as the caretaker. That would require Mr. Corbyn agreeing to stand aside, because a no-confidence motion could not succeed without his support.
And even if it did, Mr. Johnson has another trick up his sleeve, one that his supporters have repeatedly telegraphed: He could refuse to resign and then schedule a general election for November, in effect forcing through a no-deal Brexit. Dirty pool, perhaps, it would leave deep scars in the body politic. But there is nothing in the relevant law, the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, requiring the prime minister to step down immediately.
If lawmakers should succeed in quickly passing legislation outlawing a no-deal Brexit before Parliament is suspended, Mr. Johnson could try to outflank them again by 
But there could be a significant roadblock. To call an election, Mr. Johnson would need the support of two thirds of the House of Commons, so he would need opposition votes. The Labour Party 
No one seems to think this option has much chance. After all, Parliament voted 
The critical date is Oct. 17-18, when the blocâs leaders meet, providing an opportunity for 
While it is widely thought that Mr. Johnson is using the threat of an unruly exit as a negotiating tactic, it is also possible that he actually means what he says. If European leaders offer too few concessions for his liking, he might plow ahead with a no-deal exit and, given the limited parliamentary time to stop it, he might succeed. It is, after all, the default option. That would allow Mr. Johnson to unite Brexit supporters behind him in a general election either late in 2019 or in 2020. The risk, however, is that the predictions of economic chaos after a no-deal Brexit are borne out, making an election unwinnable for him (and, if things are bad enough, possibly for the Conservative Party for years to come).
There are already three cases being considered against Mr. Johnsonâs decision to suspend Parliament. Experts think these are unlikely to succeed â though Gina Miller, an anti-Brexit campaigner, defied such predictions when she won a case against Mrs. Mayâs efforts to 
She is trying again now. On Friday, former Prime Minister John Major said 
One of the three cases failed its first test on Friday, when a judge in Edinburgh refused a request by 75 members of Parliament for an immediate court order, though he still plans to hear further arguments in the case next week.
But there may be other opportunities to go to court. If Mr. Johnson refuses to resign after losing a vote of confidence and tries to push a general election beyond the Halloween deadline, a legal challenge would be likely. Then it could be judges, not lawmakers, who have the decisive voice in Britainâs biggest peacetime decision in decades.

The company has dominated e-commerce with its fast shipping. But an investigation by Patricia Callahan for ProPublica and the NYT shows that speedy delivery has a price: 
â¢ Ms. Callahan identified more than 60 accidents since June 2015 involving Amazon delivery contractors that had resulted in serious injuries, including 10 deaths.
â¢ âThat tally is most likely a fraction of the accidents that have occurred,â she writes. âMany people donât sue, and those who do canât always tell when Amazon is involved, court records, police reports and news accounts show.â
â¢ âAmazon software tracks driversâ progress, and a dispatcher in an Amazon warehouse can call them if they fall behind schedule. Amazon requires that 999 out of 1,000 deliveries arrive on time, according to work orders obtained from contractors with drivers in eight states.â
â¢ But âAmazon has repeatedly said in court that it is not responsible for the actions of its contractors, citing agreements that require them, as one puts it, to âdefend, indemnify and hold harmless Amazon.ââ

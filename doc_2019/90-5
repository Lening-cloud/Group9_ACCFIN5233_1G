â¢ Mr. Dalio writes that he has seen capitalism âevolve in a way that it is not working well for the majority of Americans because itâs producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots.â
â¢ âDisparity in wealth, especially when accompanied by disparity in values, leads to increasing conflict and, in the government, that manifests itself in the form of populism of the left and populism of the right and often in revolutions of one sort or another.â
â¢ âThe problem is that capitalists typically donât know how to divide the pie well and socialists typically donât know how to grow it well.â
â¢ âWe are now seeing conflicts between populists of the left and populists of the right increasing around the world in much the same way as they did in the 1930s when the income and wealth gaps were comparably large.â
â¢ âIt doesnât take a genius to know that when a system is producing outcomes that are so inconsistent with its goals, it needs to be reformed.â

President Trump reportedly hoped to announce a final trade agreement between the U.S. and China yesterday. But he stopped short of that, 
â¢ âThe United States and China continue to haggle over some remaining issues, including how many of the American tariffs on Chinese goods will be removed, and when.â
â¢ âIn remarks at the White House, Mr. Trump said that the deal was âvery completeâ and that the two sides had âagreed to far more than we have left to agree to.â â
â¢ âI think I can say some of the toughest things have been agreed to,â Mr. Trump added.

Rudy Giuliani, who was President Trumpâs personal lawyer during the special counselâs investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. election, is a very busy man, 
â¢ Mr. Giuliani runs âa globe-trotting consulting business,â Ms. Baker writes. âIn the past two years heâs given speeches and done consulting and legal work in Armenia, Bahrain, Brazil, Colombia, Turkey, and Uruguay, among other countries,â as well as significant work in Ukraine.
â¢ But âthe question of conflict arises, in part, because Giuliani keeps popping up in world capitals to make pronouncements that dovetail with Trumpâs foreign policy positions.â
â¢ Mr. Giuliani says he tells clients that he doesnât lobby the U.S. government. â âThereâs no conflict. Whatâs the conflict?â he said. âI donât ask the president for anything for them ever.â He later added, âI donât peddle influence. I donât have to. I make a good deal of money as a lawyer and as a security consultant.â â
â¢ âWhatever he does next, whether itâs continuing as Trumpâs personal lawyer or going back to full-time consulting, Giuliani is confident the business will continue to flow. âI got clients before I represented President Trump, and Iâm gonna get clients afterwards,â he said. âAfter I stop representing him, Iâll be doing more work overseas, because Iâll have more time.â â

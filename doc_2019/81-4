â¢ âBrett, 40, is likely to rejoin Icahn Enterprises in the coming months after a more than three-year hiatus,â Ms. Lombardo writes. âHe would run a small new investment fund.â
â¢ âFor over a year on and off, father and son have been negotiating an arrangement that has already stretched to a roughly 90-page contract.â

By many measures, the U.S. economy is performing strongly. But from G.M. plants to Chicagoâs public schools, workers are picketing â because, Noam Scheiber of the NYT reports, they feel that they 
â¢ âTo an extent, the pattern of strikes reflects a recurring feature of the labor market: Workers typically become bolder the longer an expansion continues, using the leverage they have when jobs are harder to fill to demand greater compensation,â Mr. Scheiber writes.
â¢ âOverall strike activity has fallen sharply since the 1970s, as the ranks of unions have been depleted, dropping to about 10 percent of the work force from over 25 percent.â
â¢ âNow, though, workers appear increasingly willing to walk off the job. Last year, the number of workers who participated in significant strikes soared to nearly 500,000, its highest point since the mid-1980s.â
â¢ âThe backdrop for this trend is a rising gap between the money employers are making and the portion theyâre sharing with workers. The share of the national income that workers receive fell in the early 2000s to its lowest level since World War II according to some measures, then collapsed further in 2009. It has yet to recover.â

The company is betting that consumers will be tempted by the convenience (and, presumably, slick experience) of having one company provide every scrap of content to them. But its success will rest on the quality of the content and the value on offer — and we still have little idea about either.
Lobbyists for clients like Uber and Handy are pressing legislatures to keep workers from being deemed employees, 
• In December, a Texas regulator proposed that companies using a “digital network” to dispatch workers, as Uber does with car drivers, could label them contractors rather than employees.
• That’s a big deal for gig-economy companies, who want to designate workers as contractors to avoid paying unemployment insurance and overtime, saving billions.
• This month, it came to light that Tusk Ventures, a venture-capital and political-strategy firm, appears to have been the primary author of the Texas proposal.
• Tusk was retained by the on-demand cleaning and repairs company Handy, and is run by Bradley Tusk, once a top political consultant for Uber and a large shareholder who could make millions when the company goes public.
• Tusk has also pursued similar efforts in other states, like Illinois.
• “Worker advocacy groups say the goal is to chip away at classification rules in enough places to create pressure for a broad exemption nationally,” Mr. Scheiber writes.

At the center of the college bribery scheme that ensnared celebrities and financiers is Rick Singer, a higher-education guru who said he was able to get applicants into top schools. The WSJ traced one way he operated: 
• He was a regular on the financial speaking circuit, the WSJ reports, “which allowed Mr. Singer to move through elite circles in finance, tech and entertainment.” His services often spread through word of mouth.
• “Mr. Singer listed work with other financial-services firms, including Oppenheimer and Morgan Stanley, on his website and social media.”
• “Employees at bond-fund giant Pacific Investment Management Co., based in Newport Beach, Calif., twice invited Mr. Singer to speak about the college-admission process, and the company said some there used his legitimate services.” (Douglas Hodge, the former C.E.O. of Pimco, as the company is known, has been charged in the bribery scheme.)
• “In November 2017, for instance, an employee at a Los Angeles-based financial adviser emailed Mr. Singer, introducing him to a parent who wished to make a ‘donation’ to ‘one of those top schools’ for his daughter, according to federal filings, which don’t name the firm.”
DE Shaw may be best known as the hedge fund where Jeff Bezos began his career. But as Robin Wigglesworth of the FT writes, it was also an early leader in computer-driven investing — and is now 
• “Many in the industry believe this is the future, and are rushing to hire computer scientists to help realize the benefits of big data and artificial intelligence in their strategies.”
• “People have gone insane about this, but in a good way,” Eric Schmidt, the former Google executive chairman who owns 20 percent of DE Shaw, told the FT. “We are at the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence. These technologies should benefit investing as well.”
• DE Shaw keeps its operations shrouded in secrecy. “They’re really smart, but I’ve never quite understood them,” one quant hedge fund manager told the FT.
• But there’s reason to be skeptical of its current approach, Mr. Wigglesworth writes. “Wall Street has seen several cycles of quant hype before, and many remain skeptical that traditional firms can retool their culture sufficiently to unlock the potential advantages of a more hybrid approach.”
• “Some rivals question whether it has departed too far from its roots. For instance, Two Sigma — a major quant hedge fund started by former senior DE Shaw executives — has eschewed their former colleagues’ hybrid methods.”

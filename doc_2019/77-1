Under Armour’s board grilled the athletic equipment company’s founder and chief, Kevin Plank, last year, the WSJ reports, citing unnamed sources. Its focus: 
• “Ms. Ruhle has traveled with Mr. Plank and Under Armour staff on his private jet, they said, and given the C.E.O. her input on a range of business matters.”
• Among the topics: How to handle bad press over a sneaker model and recommending that Mr. Plank get involved with the White House, at a time when other C.E.O.s were keeping their distance.
• “Ms. Ruhle’s involvement at the Baltimore company was unusual and problematic, these people said, and left employees unsure how to handle her feedback because many people believed she was romantically involved with Mr. Plank.”
• “The board asked Mr. Plank about the nature of the relationship and whether company assets were used, these people said.”
• A spokeswoman for Under Armour said the two are friends, and that Mr. Plank keeps clear lines between the company and his private life.
• “The company has grappled with complaints about its culture, including strip-club visits and inappropriate behavior by executives. Mr. Plank has spoken openly about the company’s shortcomings and vowed to make improvements.”

• “The S&P 500 is off to its best start to a year in nearly a decade, up 11 percent so far.”

• “Stock and bond prices are not supposed to rise and fall in tandem. Historically, when investors fret about the future, they pull money out of stock markets and buy relatively safe United States Treasury securities.”
• “Investors are in a familiar situation: An economy that isn’t strong enough to compel the Fed to raise rates but is strong enough for corporate America to keep expanding its bottom line.”
• “But how long this so-called Goldilocks scenario can persist will depend on the Fed’s plan for rates and the United States-China trade negotiations.”

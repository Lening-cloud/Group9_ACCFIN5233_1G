MILAN â Italy is a political laboratory. During the Cold War, the question was whether the United States could keep the Communists from power. Then Italy produced Silvio Berlusconi and scandal-ridden showman politics long before the United States elected Donald Trump. Now, on the eve of European Parliament elections likely to result in a rightist lurch, it has an anti-immigrant, populist government whose strongman, Matteo Salvini, known to his followers as âthe Captain,â is the Continentâs most seductive exponent of the new illiberalism.
Steve Bannon, Trumpâs former chief strategist, has been close to Salvini for a while. Thatâs no surprise. Bannon is the foremost theorist and propagator of the global nationalist, anti-establishment backlash. Heâs Trotsky to the Populist International. He sensed the disease eating at Western democracies â a globalized eliteâs abandonment of the working class and the hinterland â before anyone. He spurred a revolt to make the invisible citizen visible and to save Western manufacturing jobs from what he calls the Chinese
Now Bannon is crisscrossing Europe ahead of the elections, held Thursday through next Sunday. Heâs in Berlin one day, Paris the next. As he explained during several recent conversations and a meeting in New York, he believes that âEurope is six months to a year ahead of the United States on everything.â As
Polls indicate that Salviniâs League party, transformed from a northern secessionist movement into the national face of the xenophobic right, will get over 30 percent of the Italian vote, up from 6.2 percent in 2014. Anti-immigrant and Euroskeptic parties look set to make the greatest gains, taking as many as 35 percent of the seats in Parliament, which influences European Union policy for more than a half-billion people. In France, Marine Le Penâs nationalists are running neck-and-neck with President Emmanuel Macronâs pro-Europe party. In Britain, Nigel Farageâs new Brexit Party has leapt ahead of the center-right and center-left.
Salvini, whose party formed a government a year ago with the out-with-the-old-order Five Star Movement, is a central figure in this shift. The coalition buried mainstream parties. He is, Bannon told me, âthe most important guy on the stage right now â heâs charismatic, plain-spoken, and he understands the machinery of government. His rallies are as intense as Trumpâs. Italy is the center of politics â a country that has embraced nationalism against globalism, shattered the stereotypes, blown past the old paradigm of left and right.â
For all the upheaval, I found Italy intact, still tempering transactional modernity with humanity, still finding in beauty consolation for dysfunction. The new right has learned from the past. It does not disappear people. It does not do mass militarization. Itâs subtler. It scapegoats migrants, instills fear, glorifies an illusory past (what the Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman called âretrotopiaâ), exalts machismo, mocks do-gooder liberalism and turns the angry drumbeat of social media into its hypnotic minute-by-minute mass rally.
Salvini, the suave savior, is everywhere other than in his interior ministerâs office at Romeâs Viminale Palace. Heâs out at rallies or at the local cafe in his trademark blue âItaliaâ sweatshirt. Heâs at village fairs and conventions. He's posting on Facebook up to 30 times a day to his 3.7 million followers, more than any other European politician. (Macron has 2.6 million followers.) Heâs burnishing the profile of the tough young pol (heâs 46) who keeps migrants out, loosens gun laws, brandishes a sniper rifle and winks at Fascism â all leavened with Mr.-Nice-Guy images of him sipping espresso or a Barolo.
His domination of the headlines is relentless. When, during my visit, a woman was gang raped near Viterbo, his call for âchemical castrationâ of the perpetrators led the news cycle for 24 hours. Like Trump, heâs a master of saying the unsayable to drown out the rest.
âI find Salvini repugnant, but he seems to have an incredible grip on society,â Nathalie Tocci, the director of Italyâs Institute of International Relations, told me. No wonder then that the European far-right has chosen Milan for its big pre-election rally, bringing together Salvini, Le Pen, JÃ¶rg Meuthen of the Alternative for Germany party and many other rightist figures.
âThe European elections will be decisive for the future of our continent,â Macron warned in a manifesto called 
A nationalist tide is still rising. âWe need to mobilize,â Bannon told me. âThis is not an era of persuasion, itâs an era of mobilization. People now move in tribes. Persuasion is highly overrated.â
Bannon gives the impression of a man trying vainly to keep up with the intergalactic speed of his thoughts. Ideas cascade. He offered me a snap dissection of American politics: blue-collar families were suckers: their sons and daughters went off to die in unwon wars; their equity evaporated with the 2008 meltdown, destroyed by âfinancial weapons of mass destructionâ; their jobs migrated to China. All that was needed was somebody to adopt a new vernacular, say to heck with all that, and promise to stop âunlimited illegal immigrationâ and restore American greatness. His name was Trump. The rest is history.
In Europe, Bannon said, the backlash brew included several of these same factors. The âcentralized government of Europeâ and its austerity measures, uncontrolled immigration 
âIn Macronâs vision of a United States of Europe, Italy is South Carolina to Franceâs North Carolina,â Bannon told me. âBut Italy wants to be Italy. It does not want to be South Carolina. The European Union has to be a union of nations.â
The fact is
A federal Europe remains a chimera, even if the euro crisis revealed the need for budgetary integration. Bannonâs vision of Brussels bureaucrats devouring national identity for breakfast is largely a straw-man argument, useful for making the European Union the focus of all 21st-century angst.
The union has delivered peace and stability. Itâs the great miracle of the second half of the 20th century; no miracle ever marketed itself so badly. It has also suffered from ideological exhaustion, remoteness, division and the failure to agree on an effective
Salvini grew up in Milan in a middle-class family, dropped out of university, joined the League in its early days in the 1990s and was shaped by 
The danger is not exit from the European Union â the government has come to its senses over that â or some Fascist reincarnation. Itâs what Fabrizio Barca, a former minister for territorial cohesion, called the âOrbanization of the country,â in a reference to Viktor Orban, the right-wing Hungarian leader. In other words, insidious domination through the evisceration of independent checks and balances, leading Salvini to the kind of stranglehold on power enjoyed by Orban (with a pat on the back from Trump) or by Vladimir Putin. âThe European Union has been ineffective against Orban,â Barca noted. Worse, it has been feckless.
Another threat, as in Trumpâs United States, is of moral collapse. âI am not a Fascist but. â¦â is a phrase increasingly heard in Italy, with some positive judgment on Mussolini to round off the sentence. Salvini, in the judgment of Claudio Gatti, whose book âThe Demons of Salviniâ was just published in Italian, is âpost-Fascistâ â he refines many of its methods for a 21st-century audience.
Barca told me the abandonment of rural areas â the closing of small hospitals, marginal train lines, high schools â lay behind Salviniâs rise. Almost 65 percent of Italian land and perhaps 25 percent of its population have been affected by these cuts. âRural areas and the peripheries, the places where people feel like nobody, are home to the League and Five Star,â he said. To the people there, Salvini declares: I will defend you. He does not offer a dream. He offers protection â mainly against the concocted threat of migrants, whose numbers were in fact 
The great task before the parties of the center-left and center-right that will most likely be battered in this election is to reconnect. They must restore a sense of recognition to the forgotten of globalization. Pedro SÃ¡nchez, the socialist Spanish prime minister, just won an important electoral victory after pushing through a 22 percent rise in the minimum wage, the largest in Spain in 40 years. Thereâs a lesson there. The nationalist backlash is powerful, but pro-European liberal sentiment is still stronger. If European elections feel more important, itâs also because European identity is growing.
As for the curiously prescient Italian political laboratory, Bannon is investing in it. Heâs established an 
Bannon described himself as an admirer of George Soros â âhis methods, not his ideologyâ â and the way Soros had built up âcadresâ throughout Europe. The monastery is the nationalist response to Sorosâs liberalism. Thereâs a war of ideas going on in Italy and the United States. To shun the fight is to lose it. I am firmly in the liberal camp, but to win it helps to know and strive to understand oneâs adversary.

Twenty years of peace
There are no good options for the British Parliament as it wrestles with what to do about the open border between the two Irelands after Brexit. Either the border remains open, as majorities in both Irelands want, which would mean that Northern Ireland remains in the European Union as the rest of Britain secedes. Or a hard border is reinstated, threatening economic livelihoods on both sides and potentially reigniting the Troubles.
Those of us who are committed to preventing a hard border have been meeting with leaders on both sides of the Atlantic to let London know that we are prepared to bring whatever pressure we can muster against a post-Brexit American-British trade agreement unless the border stays open.
It should be lost on no one that Northern Ireland — along with Scotland, where Brexit has reignited independence passions as well —

I asked that question in last weekâs Australia Letter, when I wrote about a coastal hike that led me to wonder 
It resonated with many of you. Dozens of readers wrote to us with thoughtful suggestions. 
So Iâm turning the newsletter over to you. Here are some of our favorite responses, edited lightly for length:
âI give myself a quota of no more than 20 photos per travel. That way I think about each and every photo I take.â
â 
âI stay present when I travel by bringing only a film camera for photos. Digital cameras (even your iPhone camera roll) are the devil, you will never look back on hundreds (even a few tens) of digital photos. But youâre sure to treasure those precious few rolls of 36 exposures when you develop them after arriving back home.â
âTen-minute rule. Look. Donât touch the phone or camera for at least 10 minutes before snapping. Let impressions sink in. Contemplate, then capture.â
âI carry notebook, colored pencils and a biro to study a scene, then sketch down â that image stays in my mind years later."
âI love the idea of drawing but Iâve never been very good at it. So my substitute is to write stories about places. I take what Iâm seeing â the people, the wildlife, the coastline, the atmosphere, the history â and condense it into fragments of fiction that, for me, really encapsulate the feel of a place. As I go back and read them I remember the places I visited, and when I revisit places I can add onto the stories I wrote the first time around.â
âAt the end of a day of travel, my boyfriend and I wrote separate diaries of the dayâs events. We then read them to each other. It was remarkable how different our observations were, like we didnât experience the same things.â
âIn 1980, I spent four and a half months hitchhiking from San Francisco to New York. Two months into my travels I mailed my camera back to Australia â I didnât want anything coming between me and what I was experiencing and the people I was meeting. Even now with an iPhone in my pocket, a small sketchbook is what Iâll use if I want a visual record.â
âI turn the phone off and only turn it on when I really want to remember the view. The odd thing though is it is the âfeelingâ of the vista, rather than the vista per se, that holds the strongest memory.â
âStop and breathe for a second or two longer than is comfortable.â
Now, on to the news of the week.

I do think that this deal represents a very good deal, both for the E.U. and for the U.K., and it’s a reasonable fair outcome and reflects the large amount of work that’s been undertaken by both sides. And of course, for us in the U.K., it means that we can deliver a real Brexit that achieves our objectives. And it means that the U.K. leaves whole and entire on Oct. 31. Speaking of elected representatives, that my fellow M.P.s in Westminster do now come together to get Brexit done, to get this excellent deal over the line and to deliver Brexit without any more delay.
Britain and the 
Writing on Twitter, Mr. Johnson called the agreement a “great new deal that takes back control,” and said that Parliament would vote on the deal on Saturday.
Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission’s president, confirmed that a deal had been reached and noted that a revised arrangement on Northern Ireland was part of the agreement. European leaders later unanimously endorsed the deal during a summit in Brussels and formally sent it to the 
While the European leaders who spoke about the arrangement during a Thursday evening news conference lauded the deal, the moment was bittersweet for some of the leaders who had long supported Britain remaining in the bloc. 
“What I feel today is, frankly speaking, sadness because in my heart I will always be a Remainer,” Donald Tusk, the European Council president, said.
Mr. Johnson may have struck a deal with Brussels, but in doing so he appears to have turned his back on a group of 10 lawmakers from 
During a joint news conference with Mr. Johnson in Brussels later in the day, Mr. Juncker said that after much hard work they had reached a “fair, balanced agreement” that “provided certainty where Brexit provide uncertainty.”
Mr. Johnson said that the agreement represented a very good deal for both Britain and the European Union, but he did not address questions about how he would persuade Parliament to pass it. At a later news conference, he again deflected questions about how he would convince lawmakers, saying he was sure his colleagues “see the merit of supporting it.”
Key to securing European agreement on any deal has been approval from Ireland, a European Union member, which wants to ensure that there will not be a hard border between it and Northern Ireland, which is a part of the United Kingdom.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s moment of glory evaporated almost instantly after he announced the Brexit deal, with his allies in the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland denouncing the agreement.
But Mr. Johnson forged ahead anyway, apparently calculating that whatever the fate of the deal, he would be politically rewarded for having tried.
No policy is more important to Mr. Johnson’s leadership than his vow to pull Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31. But after opposition lawmakers 
Now he will be able to say that he has secured an agreement, including concessions from European leaders that many had thought impossible. 
Getting the deal through Parliament would require uniting his fellow Conservative Party members and picking up enough support from opposition lawmakers — an uphill task for a leader who last month expelled 21 party members after they rebelled against him by voting for a measure to prevent a no-deal Brexit. But it could happen.
If Mr. Johnson manages to pass the deal, it would cement his status as the prime minister who delivered Brexit and would allow Britain to turn to domestic issues. But if Parliament blocks the deal, Mr. Johnson could use that as fodder for a populist
Some analysts see the scenario as a win-win for a beleaguered prime minister. Others believe the new deal leaves him exposed in an early election.
And representatives of the Brexit Party, Mr. Johnson’s insurgent rivals on the right, were already calling the deal a sellout.
Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, laid out what he saw as the most important elements of the deal in an address to the news media shortly after the announcement.
In the deal, Northern Ireland would remain aligned to a “limited set of E.U. rules, notably related to goods,” he said. 
Mr. Barnier added that to “square the circle” on the question of customs duties, negotiators had decided that the British authorities would apply tariffs “on products coming from third countries, so long as those goods entering Northern Ireland are not at risk” of entering Europe’s single market.
The European Commission released a copy of the draft withdrawal agreement shortly after the deal was announced.
For goods traded into the European Union’s single market — including those traded across the border into Ireland, a member of the bloc — Mr. Barnier said that the British authorities would be responsible for imposing European Union tariffs.
Mr. Barnier also said that four years after the protocol begins, Northern Ireland’s legislature — which has been dissolved since January 2017 amid sectarian disagreements — would be able to decide by a simple majority whether to continue applying the rules.
Regarding any possible extension of the Brexit deadline, currently Oct. 31, another European official said in a press appearance with Mr. Johnson that there would be “no need” to push it back.
The comment, from Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, was interpreted by some as blocking the prospect of an extension — an outcome that could suit Mr. Johnson by applying pressure on Parliament to approve his deal.
But Mr. Juncker is in no position to rule out an extension, even though he could suggest that
Based on the bloc’s rules, any decision on a Brexit extension would require unanimous agreement among the leaders of its 27 other member states.
The Northern-Ireland based Democratic Unionist Party presented a stumbling block to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s deal for Britain’s withdrawal, announcing its opposition just hours before he was set to travel to Brussels for a European Union summit meeting. 
In an 
After the announcement of the deal, the D.U.P. said it still did not support the agreement — and said it “drives a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast Agreement,” also known as the Good Friday Agreement, which in 1998 laid out the framework for peace in Northern Ireland.
The D.U.P. said the Brexit deal was not in Northern Ireland’s long-term interest, and that it would hurt Northern Ireland’s economy and undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.
The Conservative Party has relied on the Democratic Unionists to remain in government since it lost its majority in a 2017 election, and their support for a Brexit deal is thought to be crucial for Mr. Johnson to get his deal through Parliament. 
Some staunch Brexit supporters in Parliament have said previously that they would back a deal only if the D.U.P. also did, although some of them hinted on Thursday that they would be willing to back a deal even without the Northern Irish lawmakers on board.
Britain’s opposition Labour Party slammed the proposed deal, calling it worse than the one negotiated under Boris Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May. 
But plans for trying to put the agreement to a public vote — an idea floated by Labour on Thursday afternoon — later appeared to be on hold as lawmakers opposed to Brexit feared that they did not have enough support for such a move in Parliament.
Some Labour lawmakers have argued for giving voters a chance to choose between leaving the European Union on Mr. Johnson’s terms or abandoning Brexit altogether. They want to attach an amendment to Mr. Johnson’s deal — which will be put to Parliament on Saturday — that would allow the deal to pass only on the condition that the public vote on it in a referendum.
“If Boris Johnson has confidence in his deal, he should put it back to the people in a public vote against remain — and that is an argument we will be making on Saturday,” Keir Starmer, Labour’s lead lawmaker on Brexit, 
The party’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said in a statement that he wanted “to give the people the final say in a public vote.” But he was more equivocal in televised remarks to reporters, avoiding a question about a Saturday vote on whether to hold a second referendum and saying that his priority was to vote down Mr. Johnson’s deal.
Some Labour lawmakers worry about being seen to support Mr. Johnson’s deal, even on the condition that it be put to a public vote. Others are hesitant to back a second referendum at all, fearing that it would hurt the party’s chances with those who support Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union.
Labour’s official policy is to negotiate its own Brexit deal and put that to a second public vote, letting people choose between leaving on Labour’s terms or staying in the European Union.
Residents of Northern Ireland who want to preserve the territory’s status as part of the United Kingdom said they felt betrayed by Boris Johnson’s decision to sign off on a deal with the European Union without support from the lawmakers that represent them.
“We knew we would be thrown under the bus in some way or another,” said Shaun Harrington, who lives in the mostly Protestant and unionist area of the city of Derry.
The unionist ethos is built on a desire to remain part of the United Kingdom, and many fear that the new agreement threatens that arrangement.
“They want us to carry the burden of all the negative impacts leaving the E.U. will have on the economy,” Mr. Harrington said as he watched news of the agreement on a cafe television. “It’s easy for all the politicians to get up on the telly and say the Irish issue has been solved. They don’t live here.”
Some fear that having checks and procedures on goods coming into Northern Ireland that differ from policies for the rest of the United Kingdom will push the territory into closer alignment with the neighboring Republic of Ireland, a member of the European Union. 
“We are part of the U.K. yet we will have to check items coming in from the rest of union — how is that O.K.?” asked Bernadette Hatton, 69, who lives in the mainly unionist Waterside area of
First came the tweets: A deal with the European Union had been reached. Within minutes, the pound surged against the dollar — at one point trading at nearly $1.30.
But its value headed downward as word of the Democratic Unionist Party’s opposition to the agreement spread, and by the afternoon the pound’s value had fallen below where it started the day. 
The New York Times has looked at why the pound’s value has been a barometer for Brexit talks over the past three years.

Business groups reacted to the news of a draft deal with a mix of relief that it might prevent Britain from crashing out of the bloc without a plan, and caution over potential long-term consequences. 
Many industries, including car manufacturers and aerospace companies, have warned that
For small businesses owners, who have long voiced worries about supply shortages and the loss of markets in Europe, a deal that includes a transition period would at least delay the risk of such dangers.
“Many small businesses will be relieved that there now appears to be a credible pathway toward securing a deal that avoids a chaotic no-deal on 31 October,” Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said in a statement on Thursday.
At the same time, business groups warned against rushing into a poorly thought-through deal that could damage the economy in the long term.
“If a passable deal is in touching distance, then politicians on all sides should be pragmatic about giving us the time to get there,” Jonathan Geldart, the director general of the Institute of Directors, a British business group, said in a statement.

After two years of bitter patent battles across three continents, Apple and the chip maker Qualcomm 
• The companies “agreed to dismiss all litigation between them worldwide. They added that they had reached a six-year agreement for Apple to pay unspecified royalties on Qualcomm’s patents.”
• “That deal, which was effective as of April 1, included a two-year option for an extension, plus a multiyear agreement for Qualcomm to supply chips to Apple. In addition, Apple will make an undisclosed one-time payment to Qualcomm.”
Shares in Sprint tumbled over 7 percent yesterday after the WSJ reported that 
The business of multibillion-dollar deals and complex derivative trades wasn’t Wall Street’s cash cow in the first quarter. That honor fell to 
• “Over the past 12 months, shares in Morgan Stanley, which has no retail unit, and Goldman Sachs, which has only a tiny one, are the worst performing among the six big U.S. banks, having fallen 11 percent and 21 percent, respectively.”
• “Conversely, JPMorgan and BofA, with the strongest retail units, trade at the widest premiums to tangible book value in the group.”
• “ ‘Corporate and investment banking is not a source of growth, and asset management is not [either]. All the growth is coming from the retail banks,’ said Charles Peabody of Portales Partners.”
• The big question, Mr. Armstrong writes, is how long this will last. Banks have kept deposit rates low even as the Fed’s rates have risen. But the difference between shorter-term and longer-term interest rates is narrowing, threatening that income.

Ads that ran alongside anti-vaccine content. Accusations of abetting child suicide. Viral content that showed pedophiles were flourishing in comments sections. YouTube has had a rough time recently. Daisuke Wakabayashi of the NYT looks at 
• “In an industry that celebrates eccentricity, Ms. Wojcicki presents as exceedingly normal, bordering on boring, even as elements of her digital realm burst into the real world in forms that are increasingly grotesque and sometimes dangerous.”
• “Political figures and tech luminaries alike are castigating YouTube for not doing enough to rein in the crooks, crackpots, racists, Russian agents and charlatans who call the platform home. New horrors are ceaseless.”
• Now, “YouTube wants to remove the content that violates its policies more quickly and effectively; promote better, more authoritative material and limit the spread of videos that are potentially harmful but does not break the rules.”
• “I know we can do better, but we’re going to get there,” she said in an interview. “I own this problem, and I’m going to fix it.”
• Ms. Wojcicki is unlikely to be unseated anytime soon. While she technically reports to Sundar Pichai, Google’s C.E.O., she is one of the few people at the tech giant with “walk-in access” to Larry Page, Alphabet’s reclusive co-founder and C.E.O. “She is not going anywhere,” one Google executive told Mr. Wakabayashi.

As a lawmaker, Mick Mulvaney tried to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And when the Trump administration made him its acting director, he 
• “When Mulvaney took over, the fledgling C.F.P.B. was perhaps Washington’s most feared financial regulator: It announced dozens of cases annually against abusive debt collectors, sloppy credit agencies and predatory lenders.”
• “What he left behind is an agency whose very mission is now a matter of bitter dispute. ‘The bureau was constructed really deliberately to protect ordinary people,’ says Lisa Donner, the head of Americans for Financial Reform. “He’s taken it apart — dismantled it, piece by piece.’ ”
• “Some career employees saw a kind of strategic ambiguity at work, designed to muddle decision-making and insulate Mulvaney as he neutered the agency’s enforcement work.”
• The deconstruction “offers a case study in the Trump administration’s approach to transforming Washington, one in which strategic neglect and bureaucratic self-sabotage create versions of agencies that seem to run contrary to their basic premises.”
• This “wasn’t just one of the Trump era’s most emblematic assaults on the so-called administrative state,” Mr. Confessore writes. It was “also, in part, an audition” to become the White House chief of staff.

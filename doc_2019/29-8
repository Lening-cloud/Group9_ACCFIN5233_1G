LONDON â The speaker of Britainâs House of Commons, John Bercow, who 
In a speech in Washington on Tuesday, Mr. Bercow scoffed at the idea that Parliament would allow 10 Downing Street to chart the countryâs course out of the bloc, calling it âfor the birds.â
âThe idea that Parliament is going to be evacuated from the center stage of the debate is unimaginable, is simply unimaginable,â he said. He also 
âI do feel that now is a time in which momentous events are taking place and there are great issues to be resolved,â he said. âIn those circumstances, it doesnât seem to me sensible to vacate the chair.â
He added: âThe idea that there is an inevitability for a no-deal Brexit would be a quite wrong suggestion. There is no inevitability whatsoever about that.â
Mr. Bercowâs remarks drove straight at one of the central questions about Brexitâs next stage: If a new prime minister â say, Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary â is willing to lead the country out of the European Union without a withdrawal agreement, would Parliament be able to block it?
The question is not merely academic.

On Wednesday, Esther McVey, another contender for the leadership post, matched Mr. Johnsonâs pledge to leave on Oct. 31, declaring that the only way to fulfill the popular mandate âis to actively embrace leaving the E.U. without a deal.â
Dominic Raab, another favorite to succeed Mrs. May, suggested he could push through a no-deal Brexit over Parliamentâs opposition.
âItâs very difficult for Parliament now to legislate against a no-deal, or in favor of a further extension, unless a resolute prime minister is willing to acquiesce in that â and I would not,â 
Parliament, making its opinion on the matter clear, has repeatedly voted to exclude the possibility of a no-deal withdrawal, which most analysts say would

But that doesnât mean a prime minister would be willing to override Parliamentâs will, a move that would take Britain into uncharted â and potentially perilous â political territory.
âIt has always been quite a theoretical possibility that youâd have a prime minister who would be willing to throw out such basic constitutional values,â said Jack Simson Caird, a research fellow at the Bingham Center for the Rule of Law. âTheresa May was never going to do that. The question is: How far would a new prime minister be willing to pursue it?â
Mr. Caird said that Mr. Johnson might shy away from open confrontation with the House of Commons, for fear of alienating the public.
âSay you have a showdown with Parliament, you win by taking some extreme measure, where do you go from there?â Mr. Caird said. âHe would face such fury from those who oppose him that he was acting like a dictator. I donât think itâs credible for someone like him.â

âWhen the committed Brexiteers were in a minority under David Cameron, I stood up for their rights,â he said. âPart of the speakerâs job is to champion the rights of minorities. Now, in a sense, the Brexiteers are in the majority in the Conservative Party, but there are other views, and those other views are entitled to be heard.â

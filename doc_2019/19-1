Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, has some big political problems. But his opponents also face a huge problem of their own: They still don’t have a plan — beyond opposition to Johnson’s plan.
Johnson lost a major vote in parliament yesterday, which really shouldn’t happen in a parliamentary system of government. The prime minister, after all, ought to represent a majority of parliament.
Nonetheless, most members voted to strip Johnson of the authority to set Parliament’s agenda. They did so because of his willingness to let Britain leave the European Union without a negotiated exit package — a so-called hard Brexit that has the potential to cause food shortages and other border chaos this fall. The next step seems to be that Parliament will vote to block a hard Brexit.
That could then lead to a new general election, in which British voters would have the chance to let Johnson keep the job or to replace him. But none of these setbacks for Johnson have solved a defining problem of British politics:
There isn’t majority support — in Parliament or in the country — for any single solution to the Brexit mess.
Ever since Britain voted in 2016 to leave the European Union — by 52 percent to 48 percent — the country has been paralyzed by a lack of clarity about what should come next. Most of Parliament and most of the country oppose the hard, no-deal Brexit that Johnson is willing to accept. Most also oppose each specific soft Brexit plan, like the one negotiated by the previous prime minister, Theresa May. And while 
So what happens now? I’m rooting first for Parliament to block a hard Brexit 
But my preferred outcome remains a long shot. The ultimate question is instead likely to be whether Johnson’s critics in his own party and the Labour Party can ever rally around an alternative. If they can’t, they may help Johnson do well in an upcoming election and then he’d be able to insist on his preferred outcome.

Boris Johnson has been Britainâs prime minister for not quite a day, and the reviews are in. Heâs a disaster! A fraud! A Trumpy toff and shameless showman whose ego is inversely correlated to his merit and whose tenure of office wonât just be bad for the United Kingdom, but very possibly the death of it.
Johnson might be half-inclined to agree. 
Iâve always had a vague distaste for Johnson, based mainly on his history as a journalistic fabulist, as well as the unflattering testimony of friends whoâve dealt with him personally. Also, I opposed Brexit, which Johnson recklessly championed in 2016 and which he now promises to see through, one way or another, by the end of October.
But Iâm rooting for him, hard, as you should, too. And thereâs reason to suspect that, this time, the man might be suited for the challenge and the hour.
Iâm rooting for him, first, because the alternatives are much worse. Waiting to feast on the entrails of a failed Johnson premiership are, from the left, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn â a man who called 
As between (a) an anti-Semitic bigot and (c) an anti-immigrant bigot, Iâll choose (b): Boris, who 
Iâm rooting for him, second, because Britain needs a successful Brexit, and he may be the only political figure in Britain who can do it.
It would be nice to think that the U.K. could simply hold a second referendum and that the âRemainâ camp would prevail this time. Yet thereâs no guarantee it will. And even if it did, a second referendum leading to a different result would convince nearly half the country that they had been cheated of their democratic due.
That could only energize, radicalize and even weaponize the populist right, at a moment when populism is a swelling force in global politics.
Britain voted for Brexit, foolishly, but Brexit is what Britain now needs to get.
Iâm rooting for him, third, because the United States not only needs Great Britain. It needs Britain great.
One of the frequent criticisms of Johnson and other Brexiteers is that, like Victorians born a century late, they have an exaggerated sense of the U.K.âs significance. Yet for all of its relative decline, Britain has 
All this means Britain remains a pillar of the Western world. If Johnson fails badly, more than just his mandate or career go down with him.
And yet I have an inkling that he isnât going to fail. His mistakes are many, but many of them are venial: He was sacked by The Times of London, for instance, for making up a quote concerning the love life of King Edward II (1284-1327). He has loads of enemies, but by many accounts he has a gift for personal friendship and, unlike his three immediate predecessors, a deep political base. He has a profound sense of history, and 
He has charisma. Heâs eloquent and disarming. He is capable of winning people over.
Heâll need to, if heâs going to bring Britain out of the political deadlock that led to the crushing defeats of Mayâs Brexit plan. Heâll need it, too, to negotiate a trade deal with the U.S., which Johnson has promised and which post-Brexit Britain cannot do without. For once, Britons should be grateful that Johnson, who in 2015 described Donald Trump as â
Johnson is often compared to Trump, but itâs inapt. Trump is a lout masquerading as a political virtuoso. Thereâs reason to suspect the new prime minister is much closer to the opposite. For Britainâs sake, but not just Britainâs, I hope thatâs true.

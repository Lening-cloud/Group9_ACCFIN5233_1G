As Deutsche Bank tries to turn itself around, it is relying in large part on Matt Zames, 
• Mr. Zames rose through the ranks at Bear Stearns and then helped JPMorgan Chase move past its “London whale” trading disaster. He’s now at Cerberus Capital Management, the investment firm that has a stake in Deutsche Bank and is also a paid adviser to it.
• Soon after Cerberus was hired, Mr. Zames spent weeks at Deutsche Bank’s offices. “He quickly focused on what Cerberus considered a key to Deutsche Bank’s revival: that it move quickly to take more risk with its cash,” Ms. Strasburg reports.
• He has also met with Germany’s deputy finance minister, Jörg Kukies, to discuss a potential merger of Deutsche Bank with Commerzbank (in which Cerberus also holds a stake).
• Mr. Zames’s advice reportedly hasn’t always gone down well with the bank’s executives: “Finance chief James von Moltke last fall told colleagues he felt Mr. Zames was pressuring him to move too quickly to loosen constraints on investing the bank’s cash cushion.”
• But Mr. Zames reports directly to Christian Sewing, Deutsche Bank’s C.E.O. And, as Ms. Strasburg writes, “Some insiders and trading partners half-jokingly call Mr. Zames the ‘virtual C.E.O.’”

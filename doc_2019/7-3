LONDON â The general election next month, Britainâs fourth national vote in as many years, will be a moment of reckoning for one of the worldâs oldest democracies. The ideological divide between the two major parties now yawns wider than at any other point in living memory. 
For all of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonâs exhortations to âGet Brexit Doneâ so that politics can return to normal, the truth is that regardless of the electionâs outcome, there is no longer any mundane status quo to snap back to.

Given that the next government must oversee some kind of resolution to the Brexit imbroglio, and will have the job of repairing both a dysfunctional democratic infrastructure and a tattered social fabric, the choices it makes will be far more consequential than those usually faced by incoming governments. Throw in the fact that the next prime minister will be in charge for half of the decade 
Against this backdrop, it is little wonder that far from being 
Nor is it surprising that mass polarization â part of a backlash against a discredited form of politics that attempted to elevate vast areas of public life above the fray of political antagonismÂ âÂ is on the rise. With each passing day of the campaign, support for smaller parties is

Larry Fink, who oversees nearly $6 trillion of investments at BlackRock, wrote a letter to chief executives last year declaring that businesses must make “a positive contribution to society.”
It was seen as a turning point in the debate over the state of global capitalism, 
Yesterday, Mr. Fink sent chief executives another letter, arguing that businesses cannot merely have a purpose; they must be leaders in a divided world:
“Stakeholders are pushing companies to wade into sensitive social and political issues — especially as they see governments failing to do so effectively.”
It’s a continued explanation of the stance that last year prompted Barron’s to call Mr. Fink “the new conscience of Wall Street.” Not everyone agrees with him, but he has helped further a conversation that is undoubtedly positive, Andrew writes.

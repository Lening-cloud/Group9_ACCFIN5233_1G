Intellectual property rules for new pharmaceutical products could derail President Trumpâs push to get his revised North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress, 
â¢ âWhile Mr. Trump secured Canadaâs and Mexicoâs signoff on the new agreement last year, the trade pact must be ratified by legislators in all three countries, including by Congress.â
â¢ âDemocrats, who now control the House, have already made it clear that they will not approve the new trade deal without significant changes to labor and environmental provisions.â
â¢ âNow, they are also looking for revisions to the trade dealâs pharmaceutical provisions, in particular a measure providing an advanced class of drugs called biologics 10 years of protection from cheaper alternatives.â
â¢ âA similar conflict over drug industry protections helped delay and ultimately sink the prospects for another trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.â
Jared Kushner, President Trumpâs son-in-law, went to Saudi Arabia in October 2017 in his role as a White House adviser. But his brother, Josh, 
â¢ âJosh Kushner had spent the three days before his brotherâs arrival at an investor conference, where Prince Mohammed had promised to spend billions of dollars on a high-tech future for Saudi Arabia.â
â¢ Jared Kushner cut ties to Joshâs venture firm, Thrive Capital, including by selling his interest in its funds, after he joined the Trump administration. Previously, he had appeared to be closely involved in Thriveâs operations. Meanwhile, Josh Kushner has kept his distance from his brother.
â¢ But, Mr. Kirkpatrick writes, Jared âwas nonetheless discussing American policy with the rulers of the kingdom at virtually the same time that his brother was talking business with their top aides.â
â¢ âIt is reasonable to question Jared Kushnerâs ability to be impartial,â Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, told the NYT.
Policy reversals at the Fed and the European Central Bank often catch economists off guard. But they can have a profound effect on nations that donât use the dollar or the euro, 
â¢ âSwitzerland and countries near the eurozone but not part of it â like Sweden and Denmark â rely on the bloc for much of their exports and imports.â
â¢ âThat makes growth and inflation highly dependent on the exchange rate.â
â¢ âCentral-bank stimulus tends to weaken a countryâs exchange rate, so when the E.C.B. embraces easy-money policies, as it did two weeks ago, it tends to weaken the euro against other European currencies, such as the Swiss franc.â
â¢ âBecause the E.C.B. is so large, Switzerland and others can do little to offset it.â
As speculation swirls about the exact timing of Robert Muellerâs imminent submission of his special counsel report on the Russia investigation, James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, writes in an NYT Op-Ed 
â¢ âI have no idea whether the special counsel will conclude that Mr. Trump knowingly conspired with the Russians in connection with the 2016 election or that he obstructed justice with the required corrupt intent. I also donât care.â
â¢ âI am rooting for a demonstration to the world â and maybe most of all to our president and his enablers â that the United States has a justice system that works because there are people who believe in it and rise above personal interest and tribalism.â
â¢ What Mr. Comey personally doesnât want to see: an impeachment of President Trump, because âa significant portion of this country would see this as a coup.â

This week’s trade negotiations between the U.S. and China will have to bridge a lot of gulfs between the two countries. One particularly tricky issue is that Washington wants Beijing to adopt a policy that would keep the value of China’s currency stable. 
• “While the precise wording remains unresolved, a pledge of yuan stability has been discussed in multiple rounds of talks in recent months and both sides have tentatively agreed it will be part of the framework of any final deal.”
• “The Trump administration has been clear in its talks with Beijing that any attempt to depreciate the yuan — a strategy aimed at offsetting existing U.S. duties on Chinese imports — would be met with more or higher American tariffs.”
• But currency stability may be at odds with other policies. “A U.S. request for Beijing to keep the yuan from depreciating is also potentially difficult to square with Trump and past U.S. administrations’ calls for China to adopt more market-driven reforms and complaints that Beijing manipulates its currency to gain a trade advantage.”
The British prime minister is meeting with European officials today in an attempt to reach a final compromise that would save her Brexit plan. It won’t be easy.
The Vermont senator finally tossed his hat into the 2020 ring yesterday, becoming the latest candidate seeking the Democratic Party nomination. Mr. Sanders quickly became one of the most formidable candidates: He 
• His Medicare-for-all concept, introduced in 2017, proposes moving Americans away from private health insurance to a government-provided policy. He has also pressed to cut drug prices.
• He has long criticized big banks, and has fought to break up institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. Earlier this month, he also teamed up with Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, on legislation to limit companies’ ability to buy back stock.
• He wants a higher minimum wage of $15 an hour, and has put pressure on Amazon, Walmart and other companies to follow suit.
Talks between state and federal officials on vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards 
• The Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had been meeting with California’s Air Resources Board to try and compromise on a replacement for Obama-era fuel efficiency standards.
• “The breakdown in talks adds to tension between Washington and Sacramento, which has emerged as a major antagonist to the Trump administration.”
• “No further discussions are scheduled over the critical auto industry rules, said the people, who asked to not be identified discussing the private talks.”
• California is America’s biggest auto market, and as such has set a de facto national standard for auto emissions.
The Securities and Exchange Commission unveiled a proposal yesterday that would let all companies — not just certain small ones — confidentially 
• “The conversations would allow companies to identify information that is important to investors and to gauge market interest before formally announcing a public offering.”
• “Currently, large companies must publicly file their securities offering documents to regulators before gauging investor interest.”
• “Making it easier and more appealing for companies to go public has been a central goal of S.E.C. Chairman Jay Clayton. The number of public companies has fallen by nearly 50 percent since the late 1990s.”
• But this potential change isn’t as revolutionary as others the S.E.C. has proposed, Anna Pinedo of the law firm Mayer Brown told the WSJ. “It’s not going to single-handedly change if a company was going to decide to go public or not,” she said.
The American retail giant is 
• Profits rose 69 percent to $3.69 billion.
• Online sales were up 43 percent during the quarter, matching the company’s goal.
• Same-store sales in the U.S. were up 4.2 percent in the quarter, above the 3.2 percent that analysts had expected.
The U.S. may be on the brink of a recession, but housing is unlikely to be the cause, 
• “The housing sector accounts for as little as 3 percent of economic output during recessions and about twice that during booms. Other pieces of the economy are much bigger, but they don’t change nearly as much from boom to bust.”
• “The most recent recession, from 2007 to 2009, offered one of the more exaggerated examples of housing’s guiding role in downturns. A recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that the construction sector accounted for a little over a third of the decline in output in the past recession.”
• “How does housing look now? Mixed, but mixed in such a way that the things most important to economic growth are the most stable.”
• “When economists talk about a recession in housing, they largely refer to construction, not home prices,” and “construction is bordering on moribund.”
• “In other words: Housing is in recession already. It might not get better soon, but it probably won’t get worse.”

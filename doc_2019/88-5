President Trump’s trade war with China and the gloom hanging over the global economy have many people thinking about the threat of recession in America. But some worry that there’s a danger of simply talking the U.S. into a downturn.
• G.D.P. “rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.0 percent in the second quarter, a solid pace but down from a 3.1 percent rate in the first quarter and 2.9 percent overall in 2018,” 
• The Economist says that some parts of the U.S. 
• But American corporate profits rose in the second quarter as companies reduced investment, the WSJ notes, and “U.S. households boosted spending at a 4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the strongest pace since late 2014.”
• There is no guarantee that a recession is coming. And “by several measures, the American economy continues to thrive, particularly when compared with other rich countries,” Jim Tankersley and Jeanna Smialek of the NYT write.
• But “consumers drive about 70 percent of economic activity in America, and if they become spooked and pull back on purchases, growth could slow more sharply,” they add. “Stock market losses could unsettle Americans and cause them to clamp their wallets shut.”
Uber, Lyft and DoorDash each pledged $30 million to fight legislation in California that would force them to treat their drivers as employees instead of independent contractors, 
• The companies plan to fund a ballot initiative that would essentially exempt them from the proposed law, which is part of California’s Assembly Bill 5.
• “The companies said their proposed ballot initiative would preserve drivers’ ability to set their own schedules, while Uber and Lyft would offer a concession on minimum wage standards, health benefits and collective bargaining rights,” Ms Conger writes.
• “But the bill’s sponsor, Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, a Democrat from San Diego, has said she does not foresee a deal with the companies,” Ms. Conger adds.
The Trump administration announced plans to relax Obama-era methane emissions rules this week, in a move that might be expected to be welcomed by oil and gas producers. 
• Natural gas often escapes unburned during production and distribution. Its main component is methane, which is far more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.
• Removing constraints on its emissions could hurt the argument that gas should replace coal in generating power.
Federal prosecutors are studying new allegations that Huawei stole American technology, 
• “Among the situations being examined are episodes in which Huawei was accused of stealing intellectual property from multiple people and companies over several years.”
• The inquiries “suggest that the government is investigating aspects of Huawei’s business practices that weren’t covered in indictments of Huawei issued earlier this year.”
• “They include alleged theft of smartphone-camera technology from a Portuguese multimedia producer and Huawei’s practices of recruiting employees from rival companies, the people said.”
When FedEx decided this month to cut ties to Amazon, it brought into focus a new reality: that the e-commerce giant is now a shipping force in its own right and 
• “Amazon has quietly blanketed the nation with hundreds of sprawling suburban warehouses and neighborhood package-sorting centers, flooded the streets with tens of thousands of vans and even taken to the airways,” Mr. Herrera and Ms. Qian write.
• Amazon has increased the number of its delivery facilities to roughly 400, from about 65 in 2013 , according to the consulting firm MWPVL International.
• Over the past decade, Amazon’s spending on shipping and fulfillment has risen to about $61.7 billion in 2018, from $5.5 billion in 2010. That equals about a quarter of Amazon’s revenue.
• Amazon now handles an estimated 4.8 million packages every day in the U.S., according to MWPVL, as the company now delivers nearly half of its orders itself.

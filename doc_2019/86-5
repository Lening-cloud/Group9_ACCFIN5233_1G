The most significant document is a secret directive on managing the camps that describes their inner workings: round-the-clock video surveillance to prevent escapes, a scoring system for inmates to determine whether they would be released, and blanket secrecy, including barring employees from bringing in mobile phones.
The documents were provided by Uighur overseas networks and scrutinized for authenticity by dozens of journalists in 14 countries. They add to the revelations from

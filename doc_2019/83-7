The designer is wearing a key piece from her collection, a white T-shirt featuring a print of a cartoon clown encircled by stars â a reference to the European Union â with the words âPromising Britainâ emblazoned above. âThere are very clear political undertones in the collection,â she says. âThe tongue is firmly in the cheek.

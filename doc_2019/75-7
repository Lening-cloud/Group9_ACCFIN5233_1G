Even as his officials prepare for more negotiations with Beijing, President Trump said yesterday that he expects tariffs on Chinese imports to remain “
• “ ‘We have to make sure that if we do the deal with China that China lives by the deal,’ Mr. Trump told reporters as he left Washington for Ohio.”
• “The president didn’t explain whether the U.S. is pressing to keep in place tariffs on all the $250 billion of Chinese goods the U.S. has hit with levies, or some portion of them, nor did he indicate for how long.”
• U.S. negotiators “are more willing to roll back at least some of the 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, which took effect in September as the U.S. tried to put more pressure on China.”
• But they’re more resistant to removing 25 percent levies on $50 billion of Chinese goods, imposed in response to “harm to U.S. companies caused by China’s forced technology transfers.”
• “As part of any enforcement plan, the U.S. is also asking China for another important concession — that it agree not to retaliate against U.S. tariffs reimposed for at least some violations of a trade pact.”
With just eight days to go until Britain is scheduled to withdraw from the E.U., a standoff appears to have put the possibility of a chaotic no-deal Brexit back on the table.
• Ms. May requested from the E.U. a short delay to Britain’s exit, until June 30.
• But the E.U. said it would only allow that if lawmakers endorsed her Brexit plan.
• That seems unlikely, given that lawmakers have twice rejected it already.
The Pentagon still hasn’t awarded its $10 billion cloud computing contract, which is supposed to go to a single provider. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM and Oracle are all technically still in the running. The delay stems from a legal fight between Amazon, the favorite, and Oracle, concerning 
• Mr. Ubhi worked at Amazon from 2014 to 2016, and then joined a Pentagon initiative to help the military hire techies. He also worked on the cloud contract, known as JEDI. He has since returned to Amazon.
• “In court documents, Oracle argues that Mr. Ubhi worked on JEDI when the Pentagon decided to take the approach of hiring a single cloud provider. Oracle cites internal documents in which Mr. Ubhi expressed support for a single cloud,” Ms. Weise and Mr. Kaplan write.
• “Amazon has countered that the Pentagon identified 72 people substantially involved in developing the contract and its requirements, and that Mr. Ubhi worked on JEDI for only seven weeks, in the early stages.”
• “The delays from the Oracle lawsuit could help Microsoft. In the months since the request for proposals went out, the company, which has supplied the Pentagon for decades, has improved its capabilities to the point that some experts believe it is an increasingly credible competitor to Amazon.”
Lloyd’s of London, the British insurance brokerage, is one of the oldest redoubts of capitalism in the world. But 18 women told Bloomberg Businessweek that they faced 
• A ban on women on the Lloyd’s trading floor was lifted in 1973, but a macho, sexist culture remains. Women are still referred to as “totty” and are rated for their “shaggability,” according to financial executives.
• One female executive in her mid-30s told Bloomberg Businessweek that she was assaulted by a male manager after a night drinking with colleagues. She said she was marginalized, especially after filing a complaint — while her manager remained in his job.
• Inga Beale, the first female C.E.O. of Lloyd’s, tried to increase diversity at the firm — but was told to “tone it down.”
• She tried to ban daytime drinking, a staple of the Lloyd’s culture, in 2017. Some workers “sneered that Beale was trying to run their life as if she was their mother.” The ban reportedly remains widely ignored.
• Ms. Beale left before her fifth anniversary in the role last fall, and was replaced by John Neal — whose former employer had docked his pay “for not disclosing he was in a relationship with his personal assistant.”

• In its Swedish offices, Huawei “turned to scrutinizing the network hardware of rivals.” There, “researchers stashed foreign-made equipment in an electronically secured basement,” some of which was “shipped to China to be dissected by engineers.”
• “In its offices in Texas and elsewhere, Huawei had built spy-proof secure rooms that were off-limits to American employees.” Counterintelligence officials have described it as handling information “like a state intelligence service.” Huawei said the rooms were there “to prevent spying against the company, not enable spying on others.”

• “Google’s contractors handle a range of jobs, from content moderation to software testing.”
• “Their hourly pay varies, from $16 per hour for an entry-level content reviewer to $125 per hour for a top-shelf software developer.”
• “Though they often work side by side with full-timers, Google temps are usually employed by outside agencies.”

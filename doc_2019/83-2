When heâs on the playing field, Diamantino Matamouros (Carloto Cotta), the Portuguese soccer superstar whoâs the hero of this simultaneously goofy and deft satirical comedy, doesnât see his human opponents. Instead he sees âfluffy puppies,â giant Pekingese dogs romping in pink clouds, around whom he navigates his offensive drive.
Diamantino himself is a bit of a pup, beloved by his soon-to-die father, hated by his evil twin sisters. His way of looking at life takes a double hit when he blows a particularly important penalty kick shortly after learning, for the first time, about the existence of migrant refugees. How a grown man got to his thirties without such knowledge is in part because of the bubble of celebrity. But itâs also because while Diamantino is a genius at soccer, his cognition in nearly every other respect sorely lacks.
And this is how an adult woman investigating the starâs finances can pass herself off as a preteen boy refugee and gain access to Diamantinoâs home. And no, I donât believe the audience is meant to find this at all plausible. There are moments in which this film, written and directed by Gabriel Abrantes and Daniel Schmidt, feels like an early Adam Sandler comedy remixed by 
Diamantinoâs sisters sell him to Portugalâs propaganda office, and the comeback-seeking star is hornswoggled into an authoritarian campaign with strong notes of Trumpism and Brexit. And here, the secret service agent Aisha (Cleo Tavares), who, in the guise of the refugee âRahim,â had gotten uncomfortably close to Diamantino, must make a choice. As these two characters, Cotta and Tavares make an unusually appealing odd couple â and the most idiosyncratic rooting interests the movies have served up this year.

Manufacturers want to dodge the U.S.-China trade fight by moving more of their production to Vietnam. But 
â¢ âThe specialized supply chains that made China a production powerhouse for smartphones and aluminum ladders and vacuum cleaners and dining tables are nowhere near as developed in Vietnam,â the WSJ reports.
â¢ âChina has a 15-year head start â whatever you want, someoneâs doing it,â Wing Xu, the operations director for Omnidex Group, an Asian manufacturer, told the WSJ. âYou canât just shift your business to Vietnam and expect to find what youâre looking for.â

â¢ But The Western Journalâs Facebook traffic has declined sharply in recent months, while Google News and Apple News have blacklisted the publication.
â¢ The Western Journalâs parent company has since hired a Washington lobbyist and begun publishing stories and studies claiming bias within Silicon Valley against conservatives. It has also hired Herman Cain, the former presidential candidate and Trump ally, as a representative.
â¢ âWe are committed to the truth,â Patrick Brown told the NYT. âWe are real people. We are a digital media company,â he continued. âWe are not disinformation.â

When James B. Stewart of the NYT visited Mr. Epstein’s Manhattan mansion in August 2018, he expected to talk business. Instead, he 
• Mr. Epstein “said that criminalizing sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it was perfectly acceptable,” Mr. Stewart writes.
• He also claimed to know “a great deal” about many rich, famous and powerful people, “some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing, including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use,” Mr. Stewart writes.
• “Everyone, he suggested, has secrets and, he added, compared with his own, they seemed innocuous. People confided in him without feeling awkward or embarrassed, he claimed.”
• Mr. Epstein also said he had “witnessed prominent tech figures taking drugs and arranging for sex.”
The two companies are reportedly approaching a deal that would reunite them after more than a decade apart, according to the 
It happened in August 2007. And now some people wonder whether it might happen again in August 2019. With a trade and currency war raging between the U.S. and China, plus a slowing European economy and geopolitical strains worldwide, could financial turbulence result in disaster for stock prices this month?
• “The outlook for the economy in 2020 depends in large part on which historical moment proves to be the better comparison: August 1998 or August 2007.”
• In 1998, the real crisis was taking place in the debt of emerging nations, far away from the U.S., and the Fed was able to cut rates to fend off trouble.
• In 2007, the problem had its roots at home in the subprime mortgage crisis, and a dangerous cycle of tightening credit that fueled a slowdown in the economy and losses in the financial system took hold.
The Japanese telecom company’s nearly $100 billion investment fund has created an “operating group” of 30 former executives who are advising the companies that it has invested in and encouraging them to work together, 
• “The idea is to combine the synergies of private-equity control with the more loosely coupled style of Silicon Valley venture capital,” the FT reports. “But unlike most VC firms, SoftBank’s operating team installs its own employees to work at its portfolio companies.”
• “The operating group was founded just over a year ago and is led by Gerry Lopez, a former executive at AMC Entertainment.”
• The group reportedly advises portfolio companies on issues like how best to expand and prepare for I.P.O.s, but is also working out how to “leverage the companies and make sure they are working with one another,” Mr. Lopez told the FT.
• That will be a focus of a meeting next month in Los Angeles, where the C.E.O.s of all the Vision Fund portfolio companies will gather.
• But for now, the FT writes, “many of the ideas for potential collaboration between Vision Fund companies remain at the discussion — or even conceptual — stage.”
Legal immigrants who rely on programs like food stamps and subsidized housing will find it harder to become permanent residents under a proposal announced by the Trump administration yesterday, 
• Starting in October, the government’s decisions on legal immigrants who apply to become permanent residents will “be based on an aggressive wealth test to determine whether those immigrants have the means to support themselves.”
• “Poor immigrants will be denied permanent legal status, also known as a green card, if they are deemed likely to use government benefit programs such as food stamps and subsidized housing.”
• “Wealthier immigrants, who are designated as less likely to require public assistance, will be able to obtain a green card.”
Some of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley are tripping over themselves to cozy up to the U.S. government. But their motivations are mostly about fending off regulation and avoiding being broken up, 
• Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook said last year that if his social network were broken up by American regulators, “the alternative, frankly, is going to be the Chinese companies.” But that came after he had “spent much of the last decade trying desperately to curry favor with the Chinese government,” Mr. Roose writes.
• Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, visited the White House last month to discuss government contracts and reassure President Trump that Google does not discriminate against conservatives. But that’s on the back of controversy about the company building a prototype search engine designed to be compatible with China’s censorship regime.

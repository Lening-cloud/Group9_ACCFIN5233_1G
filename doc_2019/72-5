NARVA, Estonia â On NATOâs border with Russia, soldiers with Britainâs Yorkshire Regiment recently joined Estonians in a celebration of the 100th anniversary of the 
To all appearances, it was a stirring reminder of Britainâs commitment to European defense, Brexit or no Brexit.
But the battalion, based in Estonia as a critical part of NATOâs response to Russiaâs invasion of Crimea in 2014, is the polished surface of a hollow shell â a British military that has been badly damaged by austerity and political choices that have consistently favored symbol over substance in a struggle to remain a global power.
For a military that once spanned the globe, this squad of some 1,000 troops and assorted armor represents the largest British battle group deployed anywhere in the world. Budget cuts have led to sharp reductions in troops, equipment and investment, and analysts warn that Britain is no longer capable of defending its homeland by itself.
Britain remains a nuclear power and a member of the United Nations Security Council. It is one of the few countries able to fight on land, sea and air, and its intelligence capability is world class. In a post-Brexit world, should that come about, Britainâs role as a military power will be vital to its self-image, its geopolitical clout and its relationship with the United States.
But the budget cutbacks have contributed to growing doubts in Washington about whether Britain remains capable of fighting a war alongside the American military. The British House of 
Experts say that France is gradually supplanting Britain as the leading European military ally of the United States, further weakening the âspecial relationshipâ between Britain and America â a deep concern at a time when both Brexit and the isolationism of President Trump are weighing on British security officials.
âOver the last 10 years, there is a steady decline of Britain as the partner of first choice for the U.S. military,â said Derek Chollet, the former United States assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. âLibya in 2011 was really the last gasp of Britain as a leading military power. Brexit is just a continuation and acceleration of the extended existential crisis.â
Britain has fought alongside American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and joined the fight against the Islamic State. But âthe forever warsâ have badly sapped British equipment and morale, and have deeply damaged faith in the judgment of the United States. There is waning public appetite for military adventures, and the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, is an old lefty who spent decades opposing nuclear weapons and NATO itself.
Perhaps most telling of Britainâs lower military status, the last three formal defense reviews have been predicated on the assumption that Britain will never again fight a war without the United States.
âThatâs a big concession to make,â especially in the time of Mr. Trump, said Kori Schake, a former Pentagon official who is now deputy director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. When it triggered Brexit, she added, âBritain made a big bet on the U.S. relationship, so that explains a lot of the jangled nerves now.â
Oddly, the problems with the British military echo the debate over Brexit. âWhat does Britain actually want to be in the world?â Ms. Schake said. âThey donât know the answer.â
For Julian Lindley-French, a defense analyst and senior fellow at the Institute of Statecraft in London, austerity-shrunken Britain is âretreating behind a nuclear shield, no longer with the popular will or the capacity to defend the Continent.â The British, he added, âwant the symbols of power â the nuclear deterrent and the ensign on the aircraft carrier.â
In an interview, the British defense minister, Gavin Williamson, spoke proudly of securing another Â£1 billion or $1.3 billion over the next two years for a military budget that would total 
Britain cannot have âthe scale or the massâ of the United States, he said. âBut we are the only other country in NATO that can lead the way the U.S. can lead, the only country in Europe that has the full range of capabilities.â
Britain is making difficult spending choices, Mr. Williamson said. âHow we use our technology and new ideas to improve the lethality we have on the battlefieldâ in the face of new threats. As for NATO, he said, âI struggle to think of a request from NATO that Britain hasnât met.â
Another billion helps, but in June, the House of Commons 
It is not just the level of spending, however, that is hurting the British military. More important is how the money is being spent.
The expenditures focus on two projects: replacing four aging nuclear missile submarines and building two world-class aircraft carriers, with all the ships, planes and submarines required to protect them and the F-35B fighter jets to put on them.
The nuclear program alone is costing Â£5 billion a year, or $6.5 billion, about 14 percent of the annual defense budget, with total

Presuming the annual defense budget remains more or less the same as a percentage of G.D.P., that spending on equipment and support will represent at least 40 percent of the budget. Submarines alone
The combined impact of austerity-era cutbacks and spending choices has hit the British Army the hardest of all the services. Now smaller than at any time since Waterloo, it has failed to meet even modest recruitment goals, in part because of an 
In other areas of modern warfare, however, Britainâs capacities are more highly regarded, especially in cyberdefense and cyberoffense, intelligence and space.
Tom Tugendhat, a lieutenant colonel in the army reserves who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and is now chairman of Parliamentâs Foreign Affairs Committee, said: âThe fundamental problem in defense is always personnel. Our army and navy are too small, and our reserves are not even vaguely close to being fully manned,â partly because of the new carriers and nuclear submarines.
But the big-ticket items are a measure of British resolve, he said. âThe U.K. will be the only European country with two aircraft carriers, the ability to deploy force and the willingness to do it,â he added. Island Britain âhas always used a heavy navy to project a light army,â while Continental forces usually have the reverse.
NATO may complain about Britainâs not providing territorial forces to deter Russia, âbut itâs Germany that should be providing them,â he said.
In Tallinn, the Estonian capital, the defense minister, Juri Luik, praised the British presence as a symbol of solidarity. Estonian troops fought in a British brigade in Afghanistan, he said, âso itâs a close relationship.â
Whatever their current shortcomings, Mr. Luik said, âthe British have a real military culture. They understand a battle is a battle. And they can take casualties.â

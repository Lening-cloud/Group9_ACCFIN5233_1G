For going on three years now, Britain has taken a holiday from sanity. A tiny island kingdom whose people once ruled nearly a fourth of the worldâs land area squabbles over the terms of its self-inflicted diminishing and isolation.
And really, who cares? Those who believe that history has a wicked sense of humor should care. From the depths of British bungling, hubris and incompetence is emerging a St. Patrickâs Day miracle: the real chance of a united Ireland.
After more than 800 years, itâs not just possible but also seems inevitable that Londonâs ruling reach will no longer extend to part of the island west of the Irish Sea. All of the centuries when borders from India to Africa, from the Middle East to British Columbia, were drawn by besotted and bewigged Englishmen may end with the whimpering last gasps of Brexit.
Delay Brexit, redo Brexit, no-deal Brexit. It hardly matters. 
Bear with me while I walk through the Groundhogâs Day of this muddle. When Britain 
Voters were promised a migrant-free Britain, unfettered from evil globalists. Instead, they are getting a Balkanized Britain, its stagnant economy at the mercy of forces they will no longer be able to influence in Europe. The vote was a Trump-level temper tantrum that revealed the fraudulence of conservative populism.

The Brexit vote roused the ghosts from bloody eras past, those centuries when it was a crime to be Irish in Ireland. The Troubles, three decades of late-20th-century sectarian terror that took at least 3,500 lives, was the latest iteration of that dead weight of memory.

The solution? Itâs there in the not-so-fine print of the peace agreement. Should a majority of Northern Ireland residents desire to leave Britain, it is required to call for a vote of those people.
That majority is fast approaching. 
Keefe quotes an English journalist as saying that the unionists are âmore British than the British, about whom the British care not at all.â
Paisley is no longer with us. Nor is most of the dark sentiment he stirred up. When the borders came down, so did many of the walls of religion and nationality. Catholics, long a persecuted minority, will soon be a majority in Northern Ireland if demographic trends continue.
But the conflict is less about one Christian sect against another. Itâs more about how to thrive in an interconnected world. 
Given a choice, a majority in Northern Ireland could well be persuaded to ditch what is left of feckless and intemperate Britain and form a single Irish nation â if for no other reason than they like the benefits that come with being a small country in the E.U. Of course, many things would still have to fall in place. But the stars are aligning.
Remember: This was all Britainâs doing, unintentional though it was. Hope and history donât usually rhyme. More often, they bump into each other. That happy accident could result a single Irish nation finally free of foreign rule.

I’ve become grimly fascinated by Brexit. It’s a huge news story with an uncertain outcome. And there are no longer any good outcomes. There are only bad or worse ones.

Option 1 is known as “hard Brexit”: Britain simply leaves the European Union trading zone, without any negotiated agreement that keeps some of the benefits and restrictions that come with being part of Europe.

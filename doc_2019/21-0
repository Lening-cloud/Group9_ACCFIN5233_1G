LONDON â Prime Minister Boris Johnson turned to Britainâs queen on Wednesday to limit Parliamentâs ability to challenge his plan to take the country out of the European Union in nine weeks, with or without a deal.
Mr. Johnson asked Queen Elizabeth II to suspend Parliament in September, a move that will cut the already dwindling number of days lawmakers have to find an alternative path ahead of the looming Brexit deadline on Oct. 31.
The startling maneuver, Mr. Johnsonâs boldest move since taking office a month ago, was immediately denounced by the opposition as undemocratic and possibly unconstitutional, and even a former prime minister in Mr. Johnsonâs own Conservative party said the decision could be challenged in the courts.
The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, called Mr. Johnsonâs decision a âconstitutional outrage.â Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, denounced it as âreckless,â while the partyâs finance policy spokesman, John McDonnell, called it a âvery British coup.â
The British pound fell on the news, and a â
Normally, in times of national crisis, British leaders have convened Parliament. But as the country confronts its biggest crisis in many decades, Mr. Johnsonâs decision to do the opposite and initiate a confrontation with lawmakers follows a long standoff over Brexit between the Conservative government and a divided Parliament.
Three times Mr. Johnsonâs predecessor, Theresa May, brought a deal to Parliament she had negotiated with the European Union over the terms of Britainâs withdrawal, which the countryâs voters had called for in a 2016 referendum. 
The basics of Brexit, the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union.
Even before Mr. Johnsonâs controversial step, Parliament was facing a constricted schedule in any effort to prevent Britain from leaving the bloc without a deal, which economists say would be 
Parliament had been scheduled to meet during the first two weeks of September and then to take a three-week break for annual political party conferences. It was scheduled to reconvene around Oct. 9.
But in a letter sent Wednesday to all members of Parliament, Mr. Johnson said he intended to ask Queen Elizabeth II to âprorogue,â or suspend, Parliament for a further week and to have it resume on Oct. 14 with the âQueenâs speech,â in which the monarch traditionally lays out the governmentâs agenda.
The monarchâs approval is considered a formality, and hours after the announcement, the government said that the queen had 
The formal suspension of Parliament poses a number of significant challenges to the opposition. For one, any legislation developed in the first two weeks in September when Parliament will still meet does not carry over to the new parliamentary session if not passed, meaning lawmakers will have to start from scratch.
Wednesdayâs move also forecloses any attempt by the opposition to shorten the three-week break to allow for more time to address Brexit â something lawmakers were considering. On top of that, the period of the queenâs speech is likely to take up several critical days, as Parliament debates the slate of proposals put forth.
All those obstacles reinforce Mr. Johnsonâs core goal with Wednesdayâs maneuver: making sure Parliament has as little time as possible to mount an effective challenge to his commitment to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, without a deal if necessary.
In a video interview on Wednesday morning, Mr. Johnson said he had made his decision in order to progress with âour plans to take this country forwardâ and to âget on with our domestic agenda.â

But his ploy is risky. Just how risky became clear Wednesday evening with reports that the widely admired Conservative leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, unable to defend Mr. Johnsonâs Brexit policies, was on 
John Major, the Conservative prime minister who succeeded Margaret Thatcher in 1990, said in a statement to the BBC on Wednesday that he was seeking legal advice.
âI have no doubt that the prime ministerâs motive in seeking prorogation is to bypass a sovereign Parliament that opposes his policy,â he said. âAs events unfold I will continue to seek advice on the legality of this and other matters.â
While Mr. Johnsonâs maneuver seemed like a bolt out of the blue, it was 
The prime ministerâs strike against the anti-Brexit forces conforms to a strategy he developed during the 
He has maintained that stance ever since, and some analysts see it as a tactic leading up to a general election that many consider inevitable.
Keeping open the possibility of a no-deal exit is the only source of leverage Mr. Johnson has as he tries to persuade the European Union to accept changes in the withdrawal deal that will make it acceptable to a Parliament that has already voted it down three times.
His hard-line stance also guards against the electoral threat of the Brexit Party of Nigel Farage, whose raison dâÃªtre is Brexit at any cost.
In the event of an election, Mr. Johnsonâs adamantly pro-Brexit stance will enable him to present himself as the champion of the people against a Parliament that has betrayed votersâ desire to leave the bloc.
âI suspect Number 10 believes it has created a win-win scenario with this explosive announcement,â Craig Oliver, who was director of communications for Prime Minister David Cameron, 
There is at least one intraparty potential drawback to Mr. Johnsonâs maneuver.
Some Conservative lawmakers in the rebel ranks had been pulling back from the prospect of voting against the government in the next two weeks because of speculation that the prime minister was making progress in negotiations with the European Union.
They now may believe they can no longer afford to wait and see. One of the leading Tory rebels, the former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, told Sky News that Mr. Johnson was behaving more âlike a revolutionary than a Conservative prime minister â this is tantamount to a coup really against Parliament.â
âHe will not find it easy to get his way and disregard the House of Commons and Parliament generally in this fashion,â Mr. Grieve added.
But Mr. Johnsonâs allies welcomed his gambit. âIn 400 years we havenât had a session of Parliament thatâs lasted as long as this,â Simon Clarke, the Exchequer secretary to the Treasury, 
The current session of Parliament is the 
Eddie Hughes, a Conservative member of Parliament, in a post on Twitter praised Mr. Johnsonâs âstrong leadershipâ and urged Britons to give Mr. Johnson the opportunity to withdraw the country from the European Union.
Legal experts said the move appeared to fall within the bounds of Britainâs unwritten constitution, but many saw it as a step on the path to a full-blown constitutional crisis as the fight over Brexit grinds on toward the deadline.
Yvette Cooper, an opposition Labour lawmaker strongly opposed to a no-deal Brexit, 
His move has already provoked one legal challenge, as a court in Edinburgh agreed to take up an appeal by dozens of members of Parliament to block it.
While some social media users expressed disappointment in the queenâs acceding to Mr. Johnsonâs request, observers noted that, in modern times, the reigning monarch has always obliged such a request from the government. The situation is a reflection of an unwritten rule of Britainâs political system: The throne remains removed from politics.
A Brexit deal with the European Union would be highly complicated, covering tariffs, product standards, fisheries, immigration, financial services, the border with Ireland and other issues. Mrs. May negotiated a withdrawal agreement that was nearly 600 pages long, just to secure a transition period while long-term arrangements were made. But Parliament consistently rejected it.
Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe for the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, said that even with the latest twist it was still possible that Mr. Johnson could strike an agreement with the European Union. A meeting of the European Council â set for Oct. 17 and 18 â seems to be the one window of opportunity in this new timeline for Mr. Johnson to secure a deal and win Parliamentâs approval.
Regardless of the outcome on Brexit as a result of Mr. Johnsonâs move, some thought he had set a dangerous precedent for Britain.
âWhatever oneâs views on Brexit, once you allow a prime minister to prevent the full and free operation of our democratic institutions you are on a very precarious path,â

Christine Lagarde prepares to assume leadership of the European Central Bank and confront two big topics: how the bank can tackle climate change and the economic downsides of negative interest rates.
• The central bank is preparing to debate whether to cut its main deposit rate lower than its current level, minus 0.4 percent, where it has sat since 2016 as part of an economic stimulus effort.

• “Sinogene has bigger ambitions than cats and dogs,” Ms. Lee writes: It’s cloning a horse, and hopes to clone endangered animals like the panda and the South China tiger.

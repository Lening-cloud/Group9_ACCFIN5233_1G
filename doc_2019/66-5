Known for using humor in his photography, Mr. Parr enjoyed skewering his fellow Brits.
âThe tradition of Magnum that he upheld,â Mr. Parr said, referring to Mr. Griffiths, âwas the humanistic approach of photojournalism, whose job it is to change the world.â Mr. Pharr continued, âMy job is to observe it and do my own personal interpretation, which is indeed open-ended.â
âOnly Humanâ features 19 yearsâ worth of Mr. Parrâs work, though most of the photographs were taken during the last decade. His vision of 21st Century Britain includes images dealing with the influx of immigrants into England and the rise of the nationalist backlash that led to Brexit.

Over the long conversation, Mr. Parr deflected many attempts at praise for his accomplishments (including when he mentioned that Lee Friedlander has more than 100 books as well), but in light of his current success, he was willing to be philosophical for a moment in the end.

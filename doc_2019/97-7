More from Michael Corkery of the NYT:
The hearing was also a referendum on Mr. Lampert, the companyâs chief executive and largest shareholder who has controlled Sears since 2005.
Many of the companyâs creditors accused Mr. Lampert and his hedge fund, ESL Investments, of running Sears into the ground, racking up losses and falling behind competitors, while spinning off the companyâs most valuable assets in ways that enriched his hedge fund.

But what he really did was put two peers of equal stature in conflict.â

â¢ But âthe resolution has more breadth than detail and is so ambitious that Republicans greeted it with derision,â Ms. Friedman and Mr. Thrush add. And its legislative prospects are bleak; Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly has no plan to bring the resolution in its current form up for a vote.

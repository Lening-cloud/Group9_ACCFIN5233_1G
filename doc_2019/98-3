The semiconductor industry is looking at an impending deal between the U.S. and China, and it doesnât like what it sees â whether the talks succeed or fail.
â¢ âChina has offered to buy $30 billion of U.S. chips over six years, industry officials said, essentially doubling U.S. semiconductor exports to China.â
â¢ âFor Beijing to guarantee the sales would require it to put together a kind of quota system, industry officials argued, and that mechanism could later be used to dole out contracts to Chinese firms.â
One of the biggest questions surrounding the National Enquirerâs exposÃ© of Jeff Bezosâ affair with Lauren Sanchez was how it got the photos and text messages that it published. The answer, according to the WSJ: They came from 
â¢ âMichael Sanchez, the brother of Mr. Bezosâ lover, sold the billionaireâs secrets for $200,000 to the Enquirerâs publisher, said people familiar with the matter.â
â¢ âMr. Sanchez began conversations last fall with the tabloid about his sisterâs relationship with Mr. Bezos, the people said. The Enquirer by then had already been investigating whether Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez were having an affair.â
â¢ But David Pecker, the head of the National Enquirerâs parent company, was âconcerned Mr. Bezos would sue, forcing debt-laden American Media to expend resources to defend itself for a story executives believed was unlikely to sell well on newsstands.â

When the college admissions scandal news broke last week, it exposed how the SAT and ACT tests could be gamed. Bloomberg Businessweek spoke to Rebecca Kantar, the founder of a start-up called Imbellus, who thinks 
â¢ Ms. Kantar says that standardized tests could be abused by the wealthy, through tutoring and fake scores, and give little insight about skills that will be useful in the future.
â¢ âThe digital assessments Imbellus has developed resemble video gamesâ that test decision-making, Romesh Ratnesar of Bloomberg writes. âBecause each simulation delivers a unique user experience, theyâre intended to be cheatproof.â
â¢ âWeâre establishing that simulation-based assessments are a better medium for getting at deep-thinking skills than multiple-choice tests,â Ms. Kantar said.
â¢ So far, the company has raised $23.5 million in funding, and developed employee tests for McKinsey and Company and a few others.
â¢ âKantar plans to begin giving the Imbellus test to high schoolers later this year,â Mr. Ratnesar writes. âShe also says, without going into many details, that the company is bidding to take part in a federally funded national assessment that will test 100,000 students in 2022.â

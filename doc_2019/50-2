â¢ Britainâs Parliament on Tuesday soundly defeated Prime Minister Theresa Mayâs plan to exit the European Union, a 391 to 242 vote that is likely to delay Brexit and could derail it entirely. It is a devastating blow to Mrs. May that threatens her hold on power.
â¢ The vote left the nation with no obvious way forward, just 17 days before the deadline for leaving the European Union. Parliament is sharply divided on when, how and even whether to proceed with Brexit, and whether to call an election or a second referendum.

âThe ayes to the right, 242, the noes to the left, 391. So the noes have it, the noes have it. Unlock.â âI profoundly regret the decision that this House has taken tonight. I continue to believe that by far the best outcome is the United Kingdom leaves the European Union in an orderly fashion, with a deal, and that the deal weâve negotiated is the best and indeed the only deal available.â
Parliamentâs rebuke to Prime Minister Theresa May, on the issue that has dominated British politics for three years, casts the nationâs political and economic future into confusion with just 17 days left until its scheduled exit from the European Union.
The vote is sure to intensify calls for her to either step down, call a general election, or both. Plenty of Conservative lawmakers would like to take her place as party leader and prime minister, but there is no obvious front-runner, and the outcome of a general election is just as unclear.
Mrs. Mayâs plan, painstakingly negotiated with the European Union, would have set the terms for Britainâs scheduled exit on March 29.
Unless Parliament takes some other action, Britain will leave the bloc on that date without a deal in place, which Brexit hard-liners insist would be fine, but which most lawmakers and economists say would be disastrous.
Parliament is set to vote Wednesday on whether to reject the prospect of a âno-dealâ Brexit, and to vote Thursday on whether to seek a postponement of the March 29 deadline.
The bloc would have to agree to a postponement, which appears likely, but the duration of such a delay is uncertain.
âLet me be clear,â Mrs. May said after the defeat. âVoting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face. The E.U. will want to know what use we will make of such an extension.â
Tuesdayâs vote was Parliamentâs second rejection of the plan, and there was talk of a third vote, even closer to the deadline.
Parliamentâs rejection of Mrs. Mayâs deal shifts the focus to a vote scheduled for Wednesday on whether to oppose leaving without a deal.
After Tuesdayâs vote, the prime minister said she would not try to dictate to her partyâs members how to vote on Wednesday.
âThis will be a free vote on this side of the house,â she said.
A vote against a no-deal Brexit would most likely require pushing back the originally scheduled departure date of March 29, and Parliament is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to seek a postponement.
Some hard-line Brexiteers insist that they would welcome a no-deal split as a clean and complete break from the European Union. But it is clear that most members of Parliament see it as more akin to driving over a cliff.
Formal opposition in Parliament to a no-deal departure would ratchet up pressure on the government to seek a postponement of the deadline, something that would be contingent on an agreement between Mrs. Mayâs government and the European Union.
Michel Barnier, the blocâs chief Brexit negotiator, reiterated its position that delay or no delay, the European Union was not prepared to make more concessions. âThe E.U. has done everything it can to help get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line,â he wrote on Twitter.
The British government could evade the March 29 deadline unilaterally, but only by revoking its decision to leave the European Union, a step that Mrs. May has insisted she will not take. But postponing or revoking Britainâs departure would give new hope to those who want to call a second referendum.
The 2016 referendum won with 52 percent of the vote, but Brexit opponents hope that circumstances have changed enough to reverse the result.
Prime Minister Theresa Mayâs prospects of winning the crucial vote were dealt a significant blow Tuesday morning when the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, said that the extra assurances she had negotiated with European leaders 
Mr. Cox said the concessions did âreduce the riskâ of Britainâs being trapped in the backstop â an insurance policy to ensure there is no hard Irish border, and a main issue for opponents of Mrs. Mayâs deal.
But Mr. Cox said that the assurances did not alter Britainâs rights and obligations. Were there to be a dispute, he wrote, the country would have âno internationally lawful means of exiting the protocolâs arrangements, save by agreement.â
The basics of Brexit, the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union.
Mr. Coxâs opinion was seen as influential for pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers who had been considering voting for the deal.
On Tuesday morning, Mrs. May led a meeting of the cabinet and told her senior ministers that passing the vote would allow the country to move on to a brighter future, while the alternative would be uncertainty with no guarantee of what happens next. âLetâs get this done,â Mrs. May said, in comments released by her office.
Mrs. May has 
But she faced a very steep climb: In January, Parliament rejected her deal by a vote of 432 to 202. On Tuesday, it became clear that she had not changed nearly enough minds to win.
Her voice hoarse and her political career hanging by a thread, Prime Minister Theresa May stood up in Parliament on Tuesday afternoon and tried to narrow the choice before lawmakers: Vote for my deal, she said, or Britain might very well end up staying in the European Union.
âIf this vote is not passed tonight, if this deal is not passed,â Mrs. May said, âthen Brexit could be lost.â
Mrs. May was alluding to the possibility that, if Parliament were to reject her deal on Tuesday night, lawmakers could delay Britainâs departure from the European Union, and could later get behind a softer deal or a second referendum that could reject Brexit altogether.
The prime minister, who hoped the threat of those outcomes would persuade hard-line Brexit supporters to back her deal, argued that the tweaks she had secured from the European Union on Monday had strengthened Britainâs hand and given it more power over the backstop arrangement that would temporarily bind it to European trading rules.
But the empty green benches behind her at the start of her speech were just one sign of the thin support she enjoys among backbench Conservative members of Parliament.
Even before the attorney general had issued his analysis, other legal experts had expressed similar opinions.
Apparently, the most that can be said for the changes is that they reinforce the notion that Britain can opt out of European trading rules if officials in Brussels are found to be negotiating in bad faith.
âIn the real world,â 
Three experts in European and international law, commissioned by Brexit opponents to consider Mrs. Mayâs last-minute tweaks, 
Government figures 
âGrowth remained weak with falls in manufacture of metal products, cars and construction repair work all dampening growth,â Rob Kent-Smith, the leader of the team that compiled the report, said in a statement.
Joshua Hardie, the deputy director general at the Confederation of British Industry, described a no-deal Brexit as a âthreat that is crippling business in sectors every day,â and encouraged lawmakers to vote for the deal.
The value of the pound sagged after Mr. Coxâs advice on the backstop, with currency traders fearing that his comments had hurt the dealâs chances of passing.
With the defeat of the deal, financial analysts said, the outlook for the pound, and the British economy as a whole, depended heavily on what follows. If Mrs. May resigns or calls an early election, that would inject still more uncertainty into the equation, making for a bumpy ride for Britain.

============================================= LUKE: âAn Englishman, an Irishman and a Scottishman walk into a bar. The Englishman wants to leave, so everyone has to leaveâ TOUTS: music âThis paranoia ,...â TITLE: DISPATCH FROM NORTHERN IRELAND TOUTS: Singing KASSIE: How was Northern Ireland considered when this was - MATTHEW CROSSAN / LUKE MCLAUGHLIN - I donât think it was considered at all. JASON FEENAN: Brexit is the exit of the United Kingdom based on the wishes of Great Britain. MATTHEW: (When Article 50 was actually triggered) The exact words that Theresa May used was that because of the wishes- THERESA MAY file: Under accordance with the wishes of the British people, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union MATTHEW: Great Britain consists of Scotland, England and Wales. And the United Kingdom consists of Scotland, England and Wales and Northern Ireland. (MAP) So even in her language it shows that definitely when it first happened there wasnât much thought. MATTHEW: I am struggling to see any positives for the North of Ireland. But that didnât last long. The question of Northern Ireland and its border has frustrated negotiations over Brexit. We came here to find out why. And to understand the consequences for people who live here. For the last century, Northern Ireland has had to wrestle with its identity- torn between Protestants who consider themselves British Unionists and Catholics who mostly identify as Irish Nationalists. The divide has brought years of conflict. In 1968 the Catholic minority rose up against Unionist and British control, spurring 30 years of brutal sectarian violence known here as The Troubles. In 1998 both sides came together under the Good Friday Agreement, It created a somewhat unique reality here. Northern Ireland would continue to be a part of the UK, but also, open its border completely with the rest of Ireland. But the history of The Troubles is inescapable. Murals are everywhere. And Neighborhoods are color coded along sectarian lines. Here in Londonderry, or Derry, depending on whom you ask, there are walls that separate Protestants from Catholics. And the gates are locked every night. For punk band Touts, this us and them mentality, has informed more than just their music. LUKE: Iâve lived here 22 years - me whole life, basically and thereâs places in Derry Iâve never been, or Iâve never walked to. I think thatâs crazy. MIRIAM WHYTE: Well itâs kind of rough,cause thereâs the Bogside - the mostly Catholic area then thereâs here, which is clearly the more Protestant area, but very divided, even though thereâs trying to do more what is it called when they like - integration or something. People told us those divisions have deepened since the Brexit vote. Under Brexit, Northern Ireland would leave with the UK, and the Republic of Ireland would remain in the EU. An idea that appears to overlook the reality on the ground here. We headed east, thinking we could drive along the border - but it wasnât so simple. In part because the border is mostly invisible. To get from one town in Northern Ireland to another, we crossed into the Republic of Ireland multiple times - without even realizing it. The roads continuously zigzag across international lines. Nat sound Kassie: Oh! We just crossed. Speaker: Ah good morning everyone, my name is Florence and welcome to our cross-border conference, Brexit and Young People, Can You Hear Us? These high school students live in border communities. Many commute seamlessly from one side to the other to attend school. SPEAKER: The project recruits young people from both Protestant and Catholic communities on both sides of border. LARRY: Now does anyone have some strong views on that like how would you see yourselves different than someone in the north? GIRL: If you have an Irish passport, in my mind youâre Irish, doesnât matter where youâre parents are from, doesnât matter what background you have, if you carry an Irish passport, youâre Irish. Itâs part of the Good Friday agreement: residents of Northern Ireland can choose a British or Irish passport. Or both. DOIRE FINN: People living in Northern Ireland are allowed to have a British passport and an Irish passport and I think I identify as Irish but I mean I hold a British passport so really, for my identity isnât ever something that in my family was a massive issue. My parents kind of said, âYou identify as how you feelâ and I think that that was a really nice way to bring us up. DOIRE: The census that was happening here you could either say you were Irish or British my mum wanted to identify as European and they were like, âWell, youâre not allowedâ and she was like, âNo, Iâm identifying myself as European.â And they were like âYou have to pick.â By aiming to separate the UK from the EU, Brexit could interrupt the free flow of people and goods - and violate the Good Friday Agreement. ALAN (walking with Kassie) - I hope, I hope when youâve got photographs my cows now, that we finish up getting a better price for these cows. Alan Mc Farland raises cattle and sheep a few miles north of the border. But he gets his feed from a distributor in the South. Itâs a transaction that happens regularly, without border checks, customs duties or tariffs. ALAN McFARLAND: No one knows what the final result is yet going to be - we just approach our business each and every day having made an assumption that post-Brexit we will be trading with the same people on the same terms. KASSIE: Did you feel strongly about staying or leaving? ALAN: I was actually undecided in the matter, to the extent that I didnât vote at all. But having that said in Northern Ireland the majority of the vote was remaining in the E.U. **GRAPHIC of vote breakdown** ALAN: But one thing I would say you always have the right to change is to change your mind - I would be in favor of a second referendum, to do away with the ambiguity. Thatâs because many people here remember the border as a source of hostility and violence. And a whole generation since then has grown up without one. HARD BORDER MONTAGE FARMER: NO HARD BORDER GIRL: HARD BORDER LEAD TO TROUBLE SOMEONE ELSE: IT JUST MAKES THINGS HARDER But when Prime Minister Theresa May tried to introduce a provision.. MONTAGE: BACKSTOP BACKSTOP ..that would guarantee an exit without a hard border in Northern Ireland, hardline Brexiters rejected it...arguing an open border would essentially keep the UK tethered to the EU. So no hard border, no deal, and so far no Brexit. ... Also, no sense of where all this could lead. ALAN: I think there should be a second referendum FR. McVEIGH (287_2358.MFX 09:08): I want to see Ireland reunified. Because I think itâs the only hope for this island. Economically, culturally. ANGLICAN: We need to stay with England for their money And while everyone saidsays they didnâtdonât want a return to violence, the uncertainty seems to be threatening what is already a fragile peace. //testing the countryâs fragile peace. (i think that can cover the pessimists and optimists) Police are investigating a recent bombing outside the courthouse in Londonderry reminder that the past is not far behind. ANGLICAN: We were in the sun and now Brexit destroyed the sun SIOBHAN: If there is a hard Brexit I think there will be damaged but we will have to be OK at the end of it. And weâve been through harder times than this before. FIRST NAME, LAST NAME Siobhan is a mental health expert who studieds? the effects of the countryâs history on mental health. SIOBHAN: Well, weâve got to adopt a trauma-informed approach and think about everything from the perspective of those whoâve been a victim of violence. We have no way of describing it. We have no common narrative. And itâs going to take a while for us to generate those materials. TOUTS: This paranoia, when will it end, Iâve heard it all before and Iâm hearing it again. DAOIRE: I think Iâm just really scared about the future of Northern Ireland. I love living here and I think itâs a lovely place to be. The craicâs really good and everyoneâs really friendly and I donât want that to be dragged backwards into a past that was really, really dark for so many people. And I think, you know, thereâs so many good things about Northern Ireland and I just donât want those to go away.

Thereâs some evidence that biological changes that happen in response to trauma, that thatâs passed to the next generation and in effect itâs programming the next generation to be able to respond more quickly and rapidly if thereâs a bombing or a shooting or whatever. But of course when a child has that it increases the risk of mental illness. Um, thereâve been more deaths by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday agreement than there were through the whole of the troubles through violence.

We drove The singer and drummer werenât old enough to vote in the referendum, but they live in the country many expect to be most impacted by the deal. Theirs is the generation that grew up after the good Friday agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence has only known relative peace in the region. ASSEMBLY 031019 - KASSIE NOTES Notes - I think we need in the narration a sense that, despite the fact this generation is defined by growing up in peace, there are still deep divides and conflict. Brexit has already impacted this by exacerbating polarization and creating economic uncertainty and anxiety that violence could return. I would love to try to use the Touts/kids in park/Derry to establish the âusâ v âthemâ nature of Northern Ireland - I agree the piece is not about sectarianism per se, but it sets up and personalizes the visual sense of place - the âdispatchy-nessâ - peace walls and murals, and also then might have more impact when we see that it seems most young people are united in the feeling like they werenât considered. Also, Brexit was prompted in large part by the us v them mentality in England, but in NI, as compared to the rest of UK, they already have their own us v them which continues today. **** Itâs here in Derry where many say âThe Troublesâ began, in 1968, - when the predominantly Catholic community protested against housing and employment discrimination. A civil rights march was brutally shut down by police/army. It led to roughly 30 years of sectarian violence between the predominantly Catholic Nationalists who consider themselves Irish, and the Unionists, who consider themselves British, the majority, Protestant.

Many say itâs here where the period known as the âThe Troublesâ began, in 1968, - when the predominantly Catholic community protested against housing and employment discrimination and unfair voting policies under British rule. But some claimed it to be a cover for paramilitary actors, and a peaceful civil rights march was halted by police in a brutal crackdown. 30 years of deadly sectarian violence followed between the predominantly Catholic Nationalists who consider themselves Irish, and the Unionists, who identify as British - the majority, Protestant. Sound up on Touts Touts may have grown up in the comparatively peaceful era marked by the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. But their city, called Derry by nationalists and Londonderry by unionists remains fractured. The tensions never way and in fact many say Brexit has exacerbated it TOUTS: Line about divisions still there Schools are still mostly segregated along sectarian lines. As are neighborhoods. A TKTK fence/wall helps secure the border between a Catholic community and a Protestant community. Every night, it is locked for protection. TOUTS Line about impact of Brexit already? Or line about Brexit? Just 100 feet away from the wall, in the mostly Protestant community The Fountain, we spoke with a group of teenagers about TKTK MIRIAM: Nearly everyone I spoke with mentioned/agreed the same worst case scenario HARD BORDER MONTAGE To impose a hard border, with check points and official crossings would cause headaches both practically and symbolically. And thatâs where the Irish backstop comes in.

GIRL: LIke Catholics and Protestants or Irish people and people from Northern Ireland, weâre not going to see each other as the same country LARRY youâre saying weâre both live in the same country, in my mind thatâs true, but yet I live under a British jurisdiction, Kassie: they have a lot to be fucked about Cut to: kids workshop Yeah, these kids are confused because this shit is confusing.

Borders are usually about keeping people in or keeping people out, In this case, But itâs about something more nuanced and complicated, like the border itself DRONE SHOT OF MEANDERING BORDER And Ireland, with its taste for storytelling and humor has a singular relationship with its own border People wandering in and out, funny smuggling stories. LOYALISTS EQUANIMOUS STATEMENT ABOUT BREXIT (maybe from mental health professor) CONCLUSION: AT THE BAR IN DERRY WITH THE TOUTS (with compelling TOUT SOT) One of the other key stipulations of the Good Friday agreement was a free border with the south. Now, Brexit is threatening this. Itâs the thing people I spoke with said worried them most. HARD BORDER Montage. Before I got here Iâd planned to drive along the border - it wasnât so simple. Hereâs the border. On my TKTK mile journey from TK to TK, I crossed international lines/crossed TKTK times. THIS SECTION TBA BASED ON GRAPHIC I often didnât even realize Iâd crossed. Thirty years ago, this crossing would have looked more like this: FR. McVEIGH (287_2356.MXF 03:23)): The hardline Brexit people are determined to leave without a deal if necessary, or with a deal without a backstop - (thatâs the only thing thatâs going to satisfy them, and the DUP who are propping up the London government) 04:50 The Brexiteers in London donât care all that much. Father Joe McVeigh grew up along the border and remembers the checkpoints as violent hotspots. Sound up: Fr. McVeigh shows Kassie photos of the border But this bridge at the border in Belleek shows none of the vestiges of Thatâs help spur a new momentum for a united Ireland. 13:35 If the Brexit people want to continue their line, they have to consider whatâs going to happen to us. We needed to be treated separately and differently. The fear of a hard border, with all of the economic and practical implications has given rise to another potential outcome. FR. McVEIGH (287_2358.MFX 09:08): I want to see Ireland reunified. Because I think itâs the only hope for this island. Economically, culturally. (08:54 It has to happen, it just has to happen 09:45 Partition has run out of road. ) FARMER: Voted to remain in the EU. So leaving the EU would go against the voting majority of Northern Ireland. But leaving the UK altogether would go against the wishes of some of Northern Irelandâs Protestant majority. ANGLICAN: Protestant people would certainly be nervous of any changes. Thereâs a huge amount of money that comes from Westminster and London. Ironically, the hardline Brexit position has revived some calls for a United Ireland FR. McVEIGH : I want to see Ireland reunified. Because I think itâs the only hope for this island. But positions like Friar McVeighâs arenât very popular, especially among Protestants in Northern Irelandâs 6 counties, who would become a minority overnight if they joined Irelandâs 26 as one country. So maybe they could have a political border that remains somewhat relaxed. Thatâs called a Soft Border or an Irish Backstop. Theresa May: Irish Backstop montage But no one really knows how that would work or what it would look like, which is why itâs been such a bee in the bonnet of the Brexit process. Some hardline Brexiters are calling for the re-establishment of a hard border, a fringe position that proved very unpopular with most of the people I met while I was here: HARD BORDER MONTAGE The hard border was both inconvenient and psychologically fraught. TO SIOBHAN Leaving the United Kingdom altogether would mean losing money from England. The DUP advocates it effectively mean keeping the And thatâs why the Irish backstop came up and failed?. THERESA MAY: BACKSTOP MONTAGE. When May tried to introduce a deal that said no hard border, hard brexiteers, including forcing Britain to play by the rules of a single European market even after it separates from the EU, it wouldnât pass. It was meant to guarantee that there would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after the UK separates from the EU. But then, how and where would goods undergo checks as they travel between the UK and the EU. Thereâs no easy answer? The backstop provision says Britain should continue to play by the rules of a single European market until politicians can agree on how and where goods will undergo checks as they travel between the UK and the EU. But how can the UK leave without violating the terms of the peace treaty that calls for an open border here? Which is, in part, why politicians do not agree on the terms of the backstop, and itâs unclear if they ever will. They didnât want to feel tethered to the EU. It leaves the question of Brexit unsolved and opens up new questions for Northern Ireland. It all leads to this renewed interest among some people for a united ireland. Of leaving the UK altogether. Siobhan OâNeill is a leading mental health researcher who has studied the legacy of the Troubles, And the border debate has, somewhat ironically, revived an old argument (for reuniting the north with the south) Is FR. McVEIGH (287_2358.MFX 09:08): I want to see Ireland reunified. Because I think itâs the only hope for this island. Economically, culturally. The present is more closely tied to the past here than Thereâs been a fragile peace here for 20 years but Brexit Well, weâve got to adopt a trauma-informed approach and think about everything from the perspective of those whoâve been a victim of violence. We have no way of describing it. We have no common narrative. And itâs going to take a while for us to generate those materials. But despite 20 years of fragile peace And Brexit has also had a real psychological impact on the citizens of Northern Ireland For a country that is only a generation away from one of the most bitter conflicts in modern history the tumult How will Northern Ireland SIOBHAN: LINE ABOUT HOW BREXIT HAS ALREADY HAD AN IMPACT
If you donât understand the plan for the Irish border, youâre not alone.
Confusing in the best of times and loudly debated almost all the time, 
The backstop would be a way to avoid building a physical barrier with checkpoints for goods â the kind of barrier that the European Union has done away with inside the bloc. The backstop provision of Mrs. Mayâs Brexit plan says that so long as there is no long-term trade pact, Britain would remain in the European customs union and Northern Ireland would be bound by many of its rules.
Britain could therefore remain tied to the European Union indefinitely without having a voice in shaping its rules â a nightmare scenario for hard-line supporters of Brexit. Mrs. May could cut a deal with the opposition Labour Party for a plan that keeps Britain closer to the bloc, but doing so would put her at risk of alienating her Conservative allies.
Charles Walker, a senior Conservative lawmaker and member of the influential 1922 committee, demanded on Tuesday that Mrs. May call a general election if she loses the vote on her Brexit deal.
âIf it doesnât go through tonight, as sure as night follows day, there will be a general election within a matter of days or weeks,â he told BBC Radio 4âs World at One program. âIt is not sustainable, the current situation in Parliament.â
The 1922 Committee is a group of Conservative lawmakers who meet weekly to discuss party matters. They are responsible for keeping the leadership informed of the partyâs mood.
The committee would manage any leadership ballot, although Mrs. May is largely immune from such an effort to remove her for the next 10 months since a party no-confidence vote in December failed.
At the center of the Brexit issue is the Democratic Unionist Party, a small group of socially conservative, pro-withdrawal lawmakers from Northern Ireland who wield outsize influence because they prop up Prime Minister Theresa Mayâs government.
The backstop infuriates them not so much because it might trap Britain in the regulatory orbit of Europe, but rather because it might bind Northern Ireland to more European trading rules than it does other parts of the United Kingdom.
That effectively means trade barriers in the Irish Sea, splitting Northern Ireland ever so slightly from the rest of the United Kingdom. Thatâs unacceptable to unionists, for whom the link to Britain is sacred. The D.U.P. would rather kill the backstop and risk a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
The 10 D.U.P. lawmakers were coy early Tuesday about the tweaks that Mrs. May had obtained. But after Britainâs top lawyer said the new language didnât substantially change the backstop arrangement, the governmentâs slim hopes of winning them over quickly deflated.
The Belfast Telegraph reported that the D.U.P. saw the legal advice as ânot exactly a ringing endorsement.â Other news outlets said D.U.P. officials saw no way that they could support the deal.
A faction of pro-Brexit lawmakers within the governing Conservative Party opposed Mrs. Mayâs deal after a group of its lawyers 
The prime minister needed to win over members of the faction, known as the European Research Group, to have any chance of getting her deal through Parliament.
The group of lawyers published its assessment of the extra assurances that Mrs. May had secured from European Union leaders, saying that the agreement still did not give Britain the power to extract itself from European trading rules that it would be forced to accept as part of the backstop.
âThey do not provide any exit mechanism from the protocol which is under the U.K.âs control,â the assessment found.
Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, opposed Mrs. Mayâs deal but otherwise maintained his ambivalence over Brexit as part of his strategy to buy time and come out ahead, observers said.
Mr. Corbyn has said that he does not like the plan put before the British Parliament while âbeing imprecise over what exactly is Labourâs dream deal, other than that he wants a closer alliance with the customs union and single market,â said Jonathan Tonge, a professor of politics at the University of Liverpool.
On the floor of Parliament on Tuesday, Mr. Corbyn dismissed the assurances Mrs. May had received from the European Union as âwaffle,â and said that while the prime minister had laid out a number of Brexit goals, âshe hasnât met any of those objectives."
âThe Prime Ministerâs negotiations have failed,â 
Mr. Corbynâs ambivalence has angered the partyâs primary constituencies: Although a majority of Labour voters overall wanted Britain to remain in the European Union, Brexit supporters in rural areas and working communities make up about a third of the partyâs electorate.
Mr. Corbyn has consistently rejected a âTory Brexit,â and recently said he would support a second referendum â a bid to stop a rebellion among Labour lawmakers in Parliament. But that proposal has angered many Leave voters â especially those who feel left behind by a party they believed had championed them.
âCorbyn canât ride both horses forever but heâs already ridden for quite a long distance, and there is a certain logic to it,â Professor Tonge said.

Most British citizens receive a personal greeting from Queen Elizabeth II on their 100th and 105th birthdays, and one for each year past the age of 110. Mr. Weighton told the BBC that he would ask the monarch to stop sending him cards in order to save public funds.

âI like to think Iâve lived a decent life,â he told 
As to longevity, Mr. Smith had no definitive answer, either.

President Trump looks set to sign 
The social network is in talks with the Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations of privacy violations. It could lead to a record multibillion-dollar fine, 
• “The company and the F.T.C.’s consumer protection and enforcement staff have been in negotiations over a financial penalty for claims that Facebook violated a 2011 privacy consent decree with the agency.”
• The investigation began shortly after the Cambridge Analytica data scandal came to light in March 2018.
• “Some F.T.C. officials have pressed for maximum penalties because of several new reports of potential privacy breaches since the start of the investigation. The agency can seek up to $41,000 for each violation found by the agency. In the case of Cambridge Analytica, 87 million people were affected.”
• “The current talks have not yet reached the F.T.C.’s five commissioners for a vote and it is unclear how close the two sides are to wrapping up the nearly 11-month investigation.”
Negotiators 
• “The two sides have been struggling with more than 100 issues raised by the United States in a lengthy statement given to Chinese officials in May.”
• Expectations for the talks were low, though some progress was made in the prelude to this week’s discussions. For example, China agreed to disclose more of its government subsidies to the World Trade Organization.
• But big hurdles remained, Mr. Bradsher writes, including “the Trump administration’s desire to put meaningful restrictions on China’s ability to keep investing enormous sums of money from the government, and from government-affiliated financial institutions, in a wide range of advanced manufacturing sectors that compete with American industries.”
• “The United States had given China a March 2 deadline toward reaching a deal and threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. But Mr. Trump suggested this week that he could give China more time if the talks showed progress.”
• It’s unclear whether the talks went far enough for that extension to be granted.

The New York Stock Exchange took the S.E.C. to court yesterday over a so-called Transaction Fee Pilot program that sorts listed stocks into categories with varying price controls. In 
• “The new rule amounts to an unnecessary exercise in government price-setting that will add a new layer of complexity to equity markets.”
• “The Transaction Fee Pilot imposes government control on the incentives that public markets can offer. Market-maker benefits will be sharply reduced for some securities and fully eliminated for others.”
• “The N.Y.S.E. voiced its concerns to the S.E.C. during its public-comment period. We argued that the pilot will undermine the ability of market forces to drive capital formation and will fail at its goal of measuring broker conflicts.”
• “The S.E.C. freely admits it has no idea whether its pilot program will help or harm investors. This is a black flag that should worry the White House. The stock market is not a simulation. We operate in a real-world environment with investors’ real dollars.”

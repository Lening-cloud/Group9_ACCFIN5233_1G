U.S. companies are disclosing the pay ratio between bosses and median workers in proxy filings for the first full year since the S.E.C. demanded the metric. The FT and Equilar, a compensation consultancy, 
• “Of the 100 CEOs, 11 made more than 1,000 times as much as their median employee.”

German prosecutors filed aggravated fraud charges yesterday against Martin Winterkorn, who was Volkswagen’s C.E.O. when it deceived regulators about emissions levels, 
• “The charges are the first criminal indictment in Germany against an individual in connection with the diesel scandal.”
• The indictment “includes charges of breach of trust, tax evasion and false certification, either directly or by aiding in such crimes. If convicted, Mr. Winterkorn could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.”
• “In charging Mr. Winterkorn and four Volkswagen managers whose names were not released, the public prosecutor’s office in Braunschweig tied the five to events reaching as far back as 2006.”
• “The timeline is significant because it rejects initial claims by Volkswagen that senior management became aware of the so-called defeat devices used to cheat emissions tests only after being confronted by the United States environmental authorities in 2015.”
• “Even after paying $33 billion in fines and settlements related to the scandal, the carmaker continues to face legal challenges and investigations from authorities in the United States and Germany.”

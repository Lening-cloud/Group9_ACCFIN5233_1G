An influential financier warned investors in a letter to pay heed to growing risks and social tensions — and the message is already resonating at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, 
In his annual letter, Seth A. Klarman, the billionaire investor who runs the Baupost Group hedge fund, warns that social and political division risks economic calamity:
“It can’t be business as usual amid constant protests, riots, shutdowns and escalating social tensions.”
His message is likely to encourage hand-wringing of a sort usually seen in Davos, Andrew writes.
Mr. Klarman says mounting debt in developed countries since the 2008 financial crisis could lead to a financial panic. He is especially worried about the debt load in the United States:
“There is no way to know how much debt is too much, but America will inevitably reach an inflection point whereupon a suddenly more skeptical debt market will refuse to continue to lend to us at rates we can afford. By the time such a crisis hits, it will likely be too late to get our house in order.”

The party is facing long-term and complex tests in terms of maintaining long-term rule, reform and opening-up, a market-driven economy, and within the external environment.
The International Monetary Fund brought a chill to this week’s down-jacketed procession of world leaders, 
The fund expects weakness in Europe, a slowdown in China, a possible no-deal Brexit and trade spats sustained by the U.S. to lead to 3.5 percent growth in 2019 and 3.6 percent growth in 2020, down from October’s forecasts.
“Risks are rising” after two years of “solid expansion,” said Christine Lagarde, its managing director. She added:
“Does that mean a global recession is around the corner? No. But the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased.”

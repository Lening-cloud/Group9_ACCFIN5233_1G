• “Mr. Cohen is likely to lay out a picture of Mr. Trump that is fundamentally at odds with the take-charge, top-flight businessman persona he developed on the reality show ‘The Apprentice’ over the course of a decade.”
• “Among the most explosive and potentially damning aspects of Mr. Cohen’s testimony before the oversight committee will be providing evidence of potential criminal conduct since Mr. Trump became president, according to people familiar with the plans.” Some of that is tied to hush payments made to the porn star Stormy Daniels.

Additionally, the law doubled the standard deduction that taxpayers may take, along with a host of other tax changes,” Mr. Tankersley writes.
• “The so-called SALT cap is, however, most likely to affect the richest Americans: More than half of the tax increases from the change will fall on the top 1 percent of income earners, according to estimates by the independent Tax Policy Center in Washington.”

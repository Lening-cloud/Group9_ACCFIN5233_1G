Protesters 
âI encourage everybody to look in this direction rather than another direction,â said Peter Kyle, the Labour lawmaker who was trying in vain to hold the roomâs attention as he presented a motion for a second referendum on Britainâs departure, the process known as Brexit.

To his disappointment, most of the people in the elegant, wood-paneled chamber gazed upward, at the spectacle in the visitorsâ gallery.

âI congratulate him on speaking in the way that he is, notwithstanding some other stuff that may be going on,â Anna Soubry, a proponent of a second referendum, said when she took the floor. She added with a smile that it was important that everyone support Mr. Kyleâs motion, âand doesnât get distracted by anything else.â

For most of its history, the chamber had no physical barrier between lawmakers and observers. In 1978, a visitor threw horse manure over the railing.

The police struggled to clear the gallery, where at least one protester had been glued to the glass. They arrested 12 people on accusations of outraging public decency.

That was not enough for Extinction Rebellion, which organized the protest.

A lawsuit accusing Alphabet’s board of responding to misconduct cases by paying off executives, rather than firing them, has 
• Alphabet’s board agreed to pay Amit Singhal, who ran Google’s search operations, as much as $45 million when he resigned from the company in 2016 after being accused of groping a subordinate, according to board discussions that form part of the lawsuit.

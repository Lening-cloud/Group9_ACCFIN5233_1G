President Trump can move markets with his freewheeling comments on China and more. But Bill Cohan of Vanity Fair points out several instances in which someone 
• On Sept. 10, someone bought 82,000 S&P “e-minis,” which are futures contracts linked to the S&P 500. Soon later, the Chinese government and Mr. Trump said they would suspend some levies. The subsequent market rise led to a one-day profit of roughly $190 million.
• On Aug. 23, someone bought 386,000 e-minis in the last 10 minutes of trading. Three days later, Mr. Trump asserted that he had gotten a call from China about restarting trade talks, which Chinese officials later denied. Nevertheless, the S&P 500 jumped, creating a paper profit of more than $1.5 billion.
• On June 28, someone bought 420,000 e-minis in the last 30 minutes of trading, or 40 percent of the day’s trading volume in those contracts. The next day, Mr. Trump said that trade talks were “back on track.” The markets climbed sharply upon reopening, and by a week later the trade reaped a paper profit of nearly $1.8 billion.

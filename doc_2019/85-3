A lackluster start of the year for the global economy has prompted the International Monetary Fund to downgrade its predictions for growth in the coming months, 
â¢ âThe I.M.F.âs latest economic forecasts cut the outlook for growth in 2019 to 3.3 percent from estimates of 3.5 percent in January and 3.7 percent in October. The decline has been broadly felt, with all major advanced economies, including the U.S., and most major emerging-market economies seeing deterioration in their outlook.â
â¢ The I.M.F. pointed to âtrade tensions and tariff hikes between the United States and China, a decline in business confidence, a tightening of financial conditions, and higher policy uncertainty across many economiesâ as reasons for the slowdown.
â¢ âYes, itâs a cut. But not a dramatic one. These numbers are a ways from one I.M.F. definition of recession, 2.5 percent, and miles from the contraction recorded in 2009.â
â¢ âItâs entirely possible the world economy muddles through this year. It might be messy, and there will be regional divergences aplenty. The economy may not feel great, particularly depending on where you are. That doesnât mean itâs terrible.â

Lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic are clamping down on misleading tactics used by some major tech companies to gain data from users.
â¢ Facebook will change its terms of service after bowing to pressure from the European Commission. The company âwill spell out for users how the social-media platform makes money by using their personal information to sell targeted advertising, and clarify that it can be held liable for misuse of such data,â 
â¢ American lawmakers are scrutinizing how users are coaxed into handing over data. So-called dark patterns, like user-interface designs that encourage people to share data that they may otherwise have kept private, are the focus of

The firm said yesterday that it planned to raise its minimum wage over the next two years â just a day before its C.E.O., Brian Moynihan, is set to testify alongside other banking chiefs on Capitol Hill, 
â¢ Mr. Moynihan said yesterday that Bank of Americaâs lowest-paid employees would earn $17 an hour starting next month. That will gradually tick up to $20 an hour.
â¢ âIt was another example of how big banks are trying to deal with shifting political winds in Washington, where they face new scrutiny under the Democrats, who now control the House of Representatives,â Ms. Flitter writes.
â¢ Mr. Moynihan and the C.E.O.s of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and other banks are scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee this morning.
â¢ âThe banksâ leaders must explain to progressive representatives like Maxine Waters of California and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York why they are paid more than 700 times what low-wage workers, including some tellers in their branches, earn each year.â
â¢ They will also be asked about diversity, fair lending and the financial services industryâs ties to gun makers.

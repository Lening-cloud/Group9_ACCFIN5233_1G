We should appreciate that Brexit is Britain’s equivalent of our electing Donald Trump, only much worse. In both instances, a hard core of frustrated, resentful but highly motivated voters used their vote to “send a message” to what they regarded as out-of-touch elites in Washington, London or Brussels.
In the United States, dangerous and deplorable as the result has been, there is an automatic “recall” date on the package of hopefully 2020, and, at worst, 2024. With Brexit, there is no recall date, and the result will likely be the ultimate diminution of Britain as a world political and economic power.

Watching HBOâs âBrexitâ as an American is like going to a movie with the knowledge that youâre living in the sequel.
Britainâs world-upending vote to leave the European Union â currently stymied by 
But the parallels need little underlining: complacent establishments awakening too late to public anger; the exploitation of nativism and bigotry; and the frightening efficiency of social media as a way to surface grievances and weaponize them.
This last aspect drives âBrexit,â a snappy if unsubtle first draft of history that centers on Dominic Cummings (Benedict Cumberbatch), the prickly consultant who managed the âLeaveâ campaign to victory. Balding, impatient and lacking in interpersonal skills, he presents less as a revolutionary than as the revolutionariesâ I.T. guy.
Which is sort of what he is. Cummings, as depicted here, has no burning principle beyond a vague resentment of âthe systemâ and contempt for the people who work within it. He doesnât even like referendums, which he says reduce complex issues to binaries.
But he is driven by the technical challenge and by a never entirely explained urge to disrupt politics (which he analogizes, at one point, to an operating system). Dismissing his clientsâ desire to build a broad coalition, he insists on running a divisive campaign in which the difference will be made by angry Britons who donât usually vote.
Key to this is an offer to help target voters from an obscure tech firm: Cambridge Analytica. This is where the 
Cumberbatchâs tight-wired performance is the best thing in this brisk but mechanical retread of recent events. His Cummings is an asocial savant â not unlike Cumberbatchâs

The portrayals of figures like the U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage (Paul Ryan) and the conservative London mayor Boris Johnson (Richard Goulding), on the other hand, verge on sketch-comedy impersonations. Tonally, âBrexitâ lands somewhere between the dutiful style of most HBO docudramas and the frantic arm-waving of Adam McKayâs âThe Big Shortâ and â
The film, written by James Graham and directed by Toby Haynes, is itself a thumping stamp, relying heavily on eureka moments and didactic scenes. During a conversation about the amount of data people volunteer to the internet, the camera lingers on passers-by who are glancing at smartwatches and communing with their phones.
But âBrexitâ at least knows what itâs about: the idea that febrile and deadly passions, stoked for years in politics and media, can be unlocked by messaging and technology like power-ups in a dystopian video game.
Despite its dark message, âBrexitâ often has a swinging, heist-movie feel, even if the safe thatâs being cracked is democracy. It walks through the methods of targeting people on social media by seeing what they click on (like a graphic that draws a menacing arrow from Turkey to the British Isles), then amping up the dog whistles and incitements.
The passions get more vicious and personal â in a striking scene, a focus group devolves into screams, tears and racism â until a pro-Remain member of Parliament

In the United States, of course, HBO has a record of election movies (âRecount,â âGame Changeâ). Until the network takes its shot at Americaâs own 2016 surprise, consider this a preview of coming attractions.

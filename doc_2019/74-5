A coalition of 16 states, including California and New York, 
â¢ âThe clash raises questions over congressional control of spending, the scope of emergency powers granted to the president, and how far the courts are willing to go to settle such a dispute.â
â¢ âXavier Becerra, the attorney general of California, said in an interview that the president himself had undercut his argument that there was an emergency on the border.â
â¢ âThe lawsuit, California et al. v. Trump et al., says that the plaintiff states are going to court to protect their residents, natural resources and economic interests.â
â¢ âPlaintiffs will need to establish standing by showing that they are suffering some particular injury from what Mr. Trump is doing. Several of the lawsuits involve people who own land or represent communities along the Mexican border in Texas, where Mr. Trump has put the focus of his emphasis on the need for more barriers.â

A British parliamentary committee issued a scathing report yesterday that accuses Facebook of 
â¢ âThe parliamentary report recommends the creation of a British watchdog to oversee the technology industry, similar to the countryâs approach to regulating media companies.â
â¢ âCompanies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like âdigital gangstersâ in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law,â the report argues.
â¢ Mr. Satariano also notes that the report âsuggested legally requiring Facebook and other large internet platforms to remove what the government determines to be harmful content, or risk fines or other punishments.â
Index funds, with low fees and broad exposure to the markets, are supposed to be one of the best ways to play the stock market. But Robert Jackson Jr., an S.E.C. commissioner, and Steven Davidoff Solomon of the University of California, Berkeley, point out problems with those funds in 
â¢ âThe firms that devise these indexes face little regulatory scrutiny and can face significant conflicts of interest, which have the potential to harm American investors.â
â¢ âThere certainly exists potential for manipulation. Index providers generally have wide leeway when choosing the individual companies that make up their indexes and how they are weighted.â

News stories about Americans outraged by smaller tax refunds are everywhere. But Neil Irwin of the Upshot says 
â¢ âThe tax law that President Trump signed at the end of 2017 reduced the average American householdâs 2018 average federal income tax obligation by about $1,600, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center.â
â¢ But it meant that many workers prepaid less tax. The average tax refund filed through mid-February was down 17 percent from the same time last year, according to the I.R.S.
â¢ A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, Mr. Irwin notes â which means a lower initial bill is worth more than a bigger refund.
â¢ Economists remain baffled by the phenomenon of people even wanting refunds. âWhy do they want to make interest-free loans to the government?â asks Richard Thaler, the Nobel-winning economist.

â¢ âMajor urban centers such as London, Madrid, and Mexico City are restricting carsâ access. Such constraints, plus the expansion of the sharing economy and the advent of the autonomous age, have made automakers nervous.â
â¢ â âWhen you put all these trends together, youâre going to see a cap on personal vehicle ownership start to emerge,â says Mike Ramsey, an automotive consultant with researcher Gartner Inc. âWe are near peak car.â â
â¢ âRather than signaling the end of the road for the automobile, peak car is a reflection that reurbanization and the widespread adoption of mobile apps that can summon a vehicle on demand will lessen the need for many of the 1.3 billion vehicles now on the road.â
â¢ âAutomakers may talk a good game about moving metal, but increasingly theyâre chasing profits expected to come from services that charge by the mile.â

I had drinks recently with a novelist friend, and the talk turned to our mutual distaste for Christmas carols as a category. The major chords, the marching rhythms, the simpering enforced jollity of it all. “Thumpety thump, thump thumpety thump”? Please. But there I was with my family last night, a cousin at the piano and 22 of us belting out the jingoistic standards, and it really was sort of magical. So maybe I’m not such a cynic after all. Still, the best carols — like the best books, like life itself — make room for both the shadows and the light; in keeping with this time of year, they’re as much about endings as they are about the hope of new beginnings.
Our recommended titles this week include a scathing analysis of the Brexit chaos, one novel about a time-traveling terrorist, another set in a post-climate-change dystopian future and a third about a nun investigating abuse allegations at a religious school. Another novel features a lawyer rendered mute by tongue cancer; that one’s a comedy. What light there is in these books comes from the books themselves, from the artistry and intelligence on display — virtues that also distinguish Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricant’s fascinating new history of modern product design, and Sarah Abrevaya Stein’s meticulous recounting of one family’s path through the 20th century. Finally, we recommend three essay collections by close observers of the world: Darryl Pinckney, writing largely about black experience; Maryse Condé, writing largely about food and travel; and Emmanuel Carrère, writing largely about everything under the sun. Happy New Year, everyone.

Itâs been a torrid time for Tesla, which has lost a third of its value over the past week or so. Yesterday alone it erased 21 percent in value, leading another down day for technology stocks. It follows an amazing bull run â for tech stocks in general and Tesla in particular.
Is the correction warranted?
Letâs look at it through the eyes of Tesla investors. What did they need to believe about its path ahead to have been willing to value Tesla at almost $500 billion in market capitalization at its recent peak?
We can apply traditional valuation techniques to see what would need to happen for this valuation to be justified. In theory, a companyâs fundamental value is the capital in place plus the expected added value. Value added, the theory goes, should be based on investorsâ expectations about growth and profitability. Using this basic framework, we recasted the Tesla story in terms of fundamental projections over a 10-year horizon.
There are two key aspects: sales growth and profit margins.
If Tesla is going to justify a half-trillion market capitalization, it needs to increase its sales from $24.6 billion in 2019 to approximately $140 billion by 2030. This would require an annualized growth rate of 19 percent, and end up with the company becoming as big as G.M. and Ford are today.
At the same time, Tesla also needs to expand its net profit margin, the money earned for shareholders per dollar of sales. By our calculations, its net margin will need to increase from minus 3.5 percent in 2019 to over 21.5 percent by 2030. That means that by 2030 Teslaâs margin would converge to what Appleâs is today. Toyota is among the most profitable big automakers, and its margin in its latest fiscal year was around 7 percent.
Over all, if you were willing to buy Teslaâs shares at their recent peak, then you should also be willing to believe that over the next decade Tesla will achieve the scale of Ford or G.M. with the margins of Apple. This implies that Tesla would become more than a car company: It would have to become a renewable technology company in which cars are only a small part of its business. Elon Muskâs moves into solar panels and batteries suggests that he understands this.
Eventually, expectations reflect reality and fundamental valuation drivers come into play. That said, expectations may take a long time to correct themselves if investors arenât very focused on fundamentals. Itâs possible that Tesla and other hot tech stocks will justify their recent highs, but a lot needs to go right in the long term. Perhaps investors are starting to realize this, and revising their expectations.

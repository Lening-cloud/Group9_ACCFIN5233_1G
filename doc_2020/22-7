A favorite bit of advice about writing criticism is from Anthony Lane, in the introduction to his collection âNobodyâs Perfect.â Itâs just five words: âNever read the publicity material.â The problem, he writes, is that the provided synopses deliver âa false impression of coherence.â My corollary to Laneâs maxim would be: âEven dust jackets.â
Ali Smithâs new novel, âSummer,â is the concluding volume in her immersive, prickly and politically ardent seasonal quartet. The previous novels in the series, 
Each has been on the beat of the worldâs news, from Brexit to Trump to wildfires in Australia to immigrant detainees to, now, the arrival of Covid-19. (You imagine her at the printing plant, dictating final touches as the presses churn.) Each has been like a push notice that clicks open in your mind.
Theyâve been boon companions, these novels. Itâs hard to say if theyâll hold up as lasting works of art, but theyâre certainly here right now. And later, as John Maynard Keynes said, weâll all be dead.
Iâll provide a synopsis of âSummer,â of a sort. But to properly enter this novel, as with the previous books in the series, youâve got to be willing to get a bit lost. In Smithâs hands, stories slipstream in the wake of other stories; dreams are tucked up under the armpits of serious shifts in time and space. There are no directional arrows Scotch-taped to the floor.
Smith writes about yardbird intellects, refugees from good taste and urban ease; her characters are shabby-genteel with the gentility knob turned down pretty low.
Smith is from Scotland. Iâve compared the shambolic intelligence and left-of-the-dial vision of her recent novels to the work of the film director Mike Leigh (whose name has become synonymous with âa bit tatty,â as in âthis van youâre living in is a bit Mike Leighâ) and the art-music collective known as The Mekons.
When we get momentarily baffled in a Smith novel, we donât, like Samuel Beckettâs Vladimir and Estragon, sit and scratch our hindquarters. Weâre with the author, banging down bosky mental paths. She trusts that weâll eventually notice the trail blazes on the rocks. Sheâs writing about the state of her own soul at the moment, and meaning can be up for grabs.
I began this review with Laneâs maxim because critics 
In âSummer,â characters reappear from the earlier novels in the series. Thereâs Daniel Gluck, whom we first met in âAutumnâ as a 101-year-old former songwriter. Thereâs Art and Charlotte, the vaguely annoying nature bloggers from âWinter.â Also from âWinter,â thereâs Iris, a lifelong political rabble-rouser.
Itâs good to see them all again, but you donât have to read the previous novels to gain entrance here.
Two of the central characters in âSummerâ are siblings, Sacha and Robert. Sheâs 16; heâs three years younger. They respond differently to the world theyâve been brought into.
Sacha is so woke that she wonât ride in a car because it uses fossil fuels. Robert plays violent video games and admires Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnsonâs political Svengali. (To admire anything to do with Brexit, if youâre an adult in an Ali Smith novel, is to be among the especially damned.) Robert makes mischief. He throws the familyâs Amazon Alexa into the sea, saying âAlexa, tell us how to do the breast stroke.â Covid has chucked their plans out the window.
Their mother, Grace, is a former actress with a large store of memories. Their father moved in with a younger woman but still lives right next door.
This novel has a lot to say about political prisoners and immigrant detainees of all stripes, from World War I up to the present day. Efforts are made to help some of them. Smithâs characters access what Susan Sontag called âa little civic fortitude.â Thereâs a meditation on the work of the Italian filmmaker Lorenza Mazzetti.
Along the way there is a good deal of talk about evanescence â of summertime and everything else. âYou canât put a pin through a summer,â one character says. Leave it to Robert, the malcontent, to compare summer to âthe smell round a rubbish truck as it moves through the city and like youâre stuck on a bike behind it going way too slowly down a too-narrow street.â
This novel made me laugh, quite a lot, as the generations wage war. Thereâs a moment when Sacha wants to use BrainyQuote, the egregious quotations website, as the source for a Hannah Arendt quote in a paper sheâs writing.
Grace sets her straight about the importance of solid sourcing. But Sacha gets her âOK boomerâ-style digs in anyway. âWorrying about stuff like this was what her motherâs generation did as displacement activity from worrying about the real things happening in the world,â she thinks. She says: âReturn yourself forthwith to the age of pointless educational pedantry.â
Grace gets the last word, and if Smithâs seasonal novels have a motto, it is spoken here: âThe level of attention Iâm talking about is necessary for 
The pandemic sneaks in at the margins of this novel. The drawings of the virus, Sacha thinks, âall look a bit like little planets with trumpets coming out of their surface, or little worlds covered in spikes of growth, a little world thatâs been shot all over its surface by those fairground darts with tuft tails from the old-fashioned rifle ranges, or like mines in the sea in films about WW2.â
Smithâs seasonal novels can be pretty on-the-nose, politically. Sometimes they veer into the saccharine. The water, here and there, turns brackish. But as with a strong river, their motion is fundamentally self-purifying.
âSummerâ is a prose poem in praise of memory, forgiveness, getting the joke and seizing the moment. âWhatever age you are,â one character comments, âyou still die too young.â

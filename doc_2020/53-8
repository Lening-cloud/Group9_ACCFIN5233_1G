Many thanks to David Masello for sharing his warm reflections on the editor Alice Mayhew, who died on Tuesday.
In this moment when harsh words and even harsher policies are the order of the day, it is important to remember how to read a newspaper (and to read it every day), to thank people for acts of kindness, and, as an editor, to work hard to preserve an author’s voice.
Keeping a stash of postcards in your desk drawer, encouraging young people: such simple but crucial advice.
With this article, Ms. Mayhew has become a mentor to us all.

Again, Roger Cohen speaks like no other for my broken European heart. His writings are my hymn for the European idea, for humanity.
Thank you, from a lost Austrian soul from chilly London.

Reading Dr. Joseph Stern’s account of the agonizing ambivalence surrounding cessation of medical interventions for neurologically devastated patients, I had flashbacks to the times I have been in the same situation as a pediatrician.
Like Dr. Stern’s examples, my patients were always young. But one of the most poignant lessons I learned about keeping the body alive came during my residency training, during a tough block spent in the pediatric intensive care unit.
A 13-year-old boy got hold of a relative’s handgun and shot himself through the temple. The bullet’s path was, on a C.T. scan, an almost cartoonish trajectory of destruction. His family decided on organ donation. My mentor said of the boy, “He’s now the most important patient on this unit.”
We all stood in respect as his gurney was wheeled to the operating room to harvest his organs. They gave life to seven people.

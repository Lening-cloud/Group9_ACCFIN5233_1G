In France, where fashion is considered part of the patrimony and first ladies have been front-row regulars (and supermodels), the government has long treated the industry with kid gloves. Then, in 2017, Brune Poirson arrived.
âIn the beginning, everybody thought I was crazy,â said Ms. Poirson, who is officially one of 
Both a champion of the industry and its rare critic, Ms. Poirson, 37, is playing a role in negotiations regarding President Trumpâs threats to impose tariffs on handbags and other luxury goods, also known as the âhandbag war.â Last year, she also spearheaded wide-ranging legislation that included 
âWhen youâre a young woman in government â or in general, in life â and you decide to tackle a topic like fashion, everybody goes after you,â she said in an interview. âItâs almost the end of your reputation. If I were really a politician, I would have taken nuclear energy or something. But I think there is more to do in the field of fashion. I 
It is, after all, Franceâs second-most profitable sector, worth an estimated â¬150 billion. (The first is aeronautics.)
And Ms. Poirson isnât your typical French politician.
âBrune Poirson has a very important mission for the government and for France,â said Pascal Morand, executive president of the FÃ©dÃ©ration de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, the industry organization for French fashion. âShe considers that fashion is essential and should be exemplary, and she brings conviction and determination to promoting the circular economy.â
Seated before a coffee table in a corner of a grand but sparsely furnished ministry office on the boulevard St.-Germain, early in the evening of yet another long day of 
âWe need to change the way we work,â she said in polished English. âIn politics, whatâs terrible is that things take time not because itâs difficult, but because people are unwilling to change things for petty reasons. It looks good on TV for a week if you can say you implemented something 10 years after it was planned. Itâs completely depressing. So sometimes, if you want to change things, you canât rely too much on politics.â
Her press officer, seated nearby, squirmed and reached for his smartphone; she burst out laughing. âHeâs dying,â she said. âBut itâs true.â
She is also nothing if not outspoken. A 
âCall me Madame la Ministre,â she shot back, coolly raising her tone as hoots from other senators echoed in the background.
Ms. Poirsonâs clothing style is likewise to the point: She favors minimalism, with the occasional whimsical earring. âI have to be super-simple because thatâs who I am,â she said. âNo prints, because you get bored and then you want to buy more, and I try to wear exclusively nonsynthetic materials because of all the micro plastics, unless itâs second hand, and clothes that are only made of one fabric.â
In the three years since her appointment, she has championed Franceâs embrace of a more circular economy, and drafted the 
Ms. Poirson worked with FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, chief executive of the luxury group Kering, to shape details of the â
The pact is not legally binding and was decried by critics as toothless because it lets signatories pick and choose guidelines rather than setting goals, and sidestepped the problem of overconsumption. âWell, itâs the 
Ms. Poirson has no truck with some luxury brandsâ argument that they represent only a tiny fraction of the fashion sector. âThatâs like France pointing the finger at China as the bigger polluter,â she said. âI refuse to hear that argument. Everyone should work to maximum capacities to find a solution to climate change.â She was born in 1982 in Washington, D.C. to French parents â her father worked for the World Bank; her mother restored paintings â and the family returned to France before she could walk. She and her two younger brothers grew up in Apt, in the Vaucluse, part of the then-grittier, pre-Peter Mayle Luberon region in Provence.
She knew from childhood that she wanted to work in the public sphere. But, unlike most French politicians, Ms. Poirson is not an Ã©narque, as graduates of the Ãcole Nationale dâAdministration, the primary vivarium for French political life, are known.
âI wanted to do the exact opposite of E.N.A. It was a project,â she said. âMy roots are really strong. I know exactly where Iâm from. It gives you a lot of strength to go anywhere else, anywhere in the world. And I went with the intention of coming back, always.â
That path led to the London School of Economics; Laos â where she spent a year working on education, particularly of young girls, among the Hmong ethnic minority; and, by 2008, New Delhi, where she worked in the public and private sectors, for the Indian cabinet minister Satyan Pitroda and the French company Veolia.
In 2016, she studied political science and sustainability at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, but the combination of the American and French presidential campaigns, Brexit and new motherhood brought her back to France to run for office.
âPeople often say that when you have a family, you just want to protect them,â she said. âFor me, it was the opposite, in a way. I had a daughter, so I had to work twice as hard.â
She ran for local office in the Vaucluse area and used a grass roots campaign to beat the far-right candidate Marion MarÃ©chal Le Pen (niece of Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front and Mr. Macronâs former opponent). Within 48 hours, Mr. Philippe, the prime minister, invited her to join the government.
Ms. Poirson said her next steps are ânot necessarily legislation, but keeping the fight on sustainable fashion.â She said she would like to establish a fund for innovative fashion brands working to change the production system, though has few specifics.
Her position on handbags getting swept up in a possible trade war? âGetting into logistics of commercial sanctions will only create losers,â she said. âCommercial conflicts are just a source of uncertainty and weigh down global growth.â
And she wants to revive sectors like Franceâs lace industry now hanging by a thread.
âI want to go back to the areas in France with a strong textile history and see how we can actually return to local production,â she said. âI believe in path dependency â when a place is good at one thing, I think you can really rebuild on that.â

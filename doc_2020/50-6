Bowing to pressure from Beijing, the European Union this week softened criticism of China in a report on disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, The New York Times has learned.
The initial report, obtained by The Times, was not particularly strident â a roundup of publicly available information and news reports. But documents, emails and interviews show how European officials delayed and then rewrote the document to dilute the focus on China, a vital trading partner.
A version of the report that was about to be released on Tuesday cited Beijingâs efforts to curtail mentions of the virusâs origins in China, in part by blaming the United States
âChina has continued to run a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image,â the report said.
Chinese officials contacted European Union representatives to try to kill the report. In an email written on Tuesday and seen by the Times, a European diplomat warned of Chinese retaliation.

The changes angered and frustrated some diplomats and disinformation analysts. At least one analyst formally objected, writing to her bosses that the European Union was âself-censoring to appease the Chinese Communist Party.â
The fight over the document is part of a broad, global battle over the coronavirus narrative. And it comes at a time when the European Union hopes to win trade concessions from Beijing and restore a rich relationship once the pandemic has passed.
The virus has infected more than 133,649,100 people and has been detected in nearly every country.
Before Paris became a theme park for the global affluent, there was an older Paris I knew as a child, where sculpted horse heads announced butcher shops and you were likelier to find cÃ©leri rÃ©moulade at the corner than $30,000 handbags aimed at tourists.
Echoes of that Paris have come back to me over the last month as the

For those willing to brave police checks, this is a remarkable chance to rediscover Paris. In recent days, I saw for the first time â in a relationship with France that is nearly 60 years old â an epicenter of mass tourism, the beguiling Place du Tertre at the top of Montmartre. The little village square was nearly empty, and a worried Parisian stopped to ask if I wasnât taking a chance by being out on my bike.
But it is all an illusion. Paris is no more Paris without its smart young people chattering outside at now closed cafes than New York is New York without skyscrapers. Paris reduced to its architectural essence is grandiose but cold, an unreal postcard.
Yet it is also a fertile theater for the imagination. 
The pandemic cast a long shadow across Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, celebration and prayer that started for many of the worldâs 1.8 billion Muslims on Friday.
From the eerily deserted Saudi cities of Mecca and Medina, home to Islamâs holiest sites, to Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority nation, mosques were shuttered and communal prayers forbidden as worshipers adjusted to the jarring reality of a uniquely restricted Ramadan.
Indonesiaâs largest Islamic organizations issued fatwas urging followers not to gather for traditional prayers or iftar communal dinners to break their fast. One cited the Prophet Muhammadâs words advising followers not to enter a disease-stricken area or leave a place where a plague has struck.
In an address on the eve of Ramadan, the prime minister of Malaysia, Muhyiddin Yassin, hailed his countryâs âjihadâ against the pandemic â new cases have dropped significantly in recent days â but extended a lockdown by two weeks.
There were clusters of resistance in a handful of places, however, led by headstrong clerics or worshipers, as well as outbursts of protest. In a month that has included Easter and Passover, other faiths 
People packed into mosques across Indonesiaâs autonomous province of Aceh, where clerics had ruled that prayers could continue, with at least 10,000 attending the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque, according to local news media reports.
In Egypt, most people followed an order from the Grand Imam of Al Azhar, the revered center of Islamic scholarship, to perform their prayers at home, but some chafed at the restrictions.

In the upscale district of Zamalek in central Cairo on Friday, a small group gathered to offer their prayers on the street, close to a shuttered mosque.
Doctors in Pakistan have issued an urgent warning that the government was loosening its coronavirus lockdown too soon, 
âThe next two to three weeks are very crucial,â said officials of the Pakistan Medical Association, a representative body of medical professionals.
As of Friday, Pakistan listed 11,155 active cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by 
But Dr. Ashraf Nizami, the president of the associationâs Lahore chapter, said that testing in the country was starkly insufficient, and that the true numbers were likely much higher.
âI donât want to scare you, but I would like to inform you that the cases are not in thousands, the number is much higher,â Dr. Nizami said during a televised news briefing in Lahore.
Dr. Nizami and his peers have also heavily criticized the move by the government to allow prayers in the mosques during the holy month of Ramadan, stressing that it would lead to an alarming spread of cases. The government and clerics have agreed on some safety measures, including urging worshipers to keep distance among themselves. But doctors fear that religious congregations will simply ignore the guidelines.
âThe rule of a 6-foot distance between worshipers is not possible practically. We appeal to the government to review its decision and establish the writ of the state,â Nizami said.
Doctorsâ representatives said the countryâs already debilitated health infrastructure simply cannot cope with the health emergency if the numbers of coronavirus cases increase sharply. There is already a shortage of ventilators for patients, of isolation wards and beds, and of 
Prime Minister Imran Khan has been averse to a complete lockdown in the country from the start, stressing that daily wage workers and the poor cannot survive an economic shutdown. Mr. Khan said Thursday that the country should move toward a âsmart lockdown.â
Belgium will begin a gradual lifting of lockdown measures in May, Prime Minister Sophie WilmÃ¨s said during a news conference on Friday. 
On May 4, certain shops, including those selling fabric, will be allowed to reopen, provided they can follow social distancing measures. Public transportation will resume, and face masks covering nose and mouth will be obligatory for passengers over 12 years old. The government will provide at least one mask for every citizen, Ms. WilmÃ¨s said.
Some open-air recreational sports, like tennis and horseback riding will be allowed, as well as outdoor meetings of three people. Teleworking will continue, wherever possible.
A target date of May 11 is set for the reopening of all other shops, following strict precautions. Classes in primary and secondary schools will resume gradually in mid-May, with face masks mandatory for all employees and students over 12 years old. Kindergartens will remain closed until at least the end of May.
While Belgium has recorded nearly 6,700 coronavirus deaths, with a per capita death rate higher than Italyâs, it has included suspected deaths and deaths in care homes, unlike other countries.
Ms. WilmÃ¨s said the dates were targets that could change. âIt will be a gradual process,â Ms. WilmÃ¨s. âWe will need to adapt certain measures depending on the evolution of the virus. We cannot rule out going backwards.â

President Trumpâs decision to suspend family-based immigration because of the coronavirus is the beginning of a broader strategy to reduce the flow of foreigners into the United States, Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trumpâs immigration agenda, told a group of conservative allies, according to an audio recording of the conference call obtained by The New York Times. 
During a private conference call on Thursday with the presidentâs supporters, Mr. Miller sought to reassure them of Mr. Trumpâs commitment to their cause and urged them to publicly defend his executive order. He pledged that it was only a first step in the administrationâs longer-term goal of shrinking legal immigration.
âThe first and most important thing is to turn off the faucet of new immigrant labor â mission accomplished â with signing that executive order,â Mr. Miller said.

Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promised that the government would give two masks to every household in Japan. Now many of them are being recalled, according to two of the companies that produced them, in response to complaints about their quality and cleanliness.
The Japanese manufacturers Itochu and Kowa on Thursday announced that they would collect all undistributed masks and examine them for problems, following requests from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.
Days earlier, the health ministry said that it had received nearly 2,000 complaints about the masks, after its staff began delivering 500,000 of them, meant for use by pregnant women.
Mr. Abeâs mask-giveaway plan was mocked from the moment he announced it on April 1. Some social media wags called it âAbenomasks,â a play on the leaderâs eponymous economic plan, known as Abenomics. Others posted illustrations of the countryâs most beloved cartoon families fighting over the masks.
Once distribution began, the jokes turned to anger, as people posted photos of newly opened masks covered in filth, or freshly washed ones that had shrunk to the point of being unusable.
Both companies said in statements on Thursday that heavy demand had forced them to produce the masks outside of Japan â a not-so-subtle hint that the problems were related to unreliable foreign manufacturers.
While Itochu referred vaguely to problems âoverseas,â Kowa singled out China.
Demand for surgical masks has been especially high in Japan, where it has long been customary to wear them during flu season, and even companies that would not normally produce them have gotten into the business.
On Tuesday, after a flood of eager consumers crashed the website of the electronics manufacturer Sharp, the company said that it would sell its latest line of masks via lottery.

Germany welcomed home passengers on the last flight of repatriated residents, which landed at Frankfurt Airport on Friday morning, ending an ambitious program started by the government in mid-March when around 240,000 Germans were left stranded by closed borders and reduced flights.
The unscheduled flight from Cape Town, which was operated by South African Airways, touched down at 9:35 a.m. local time, roughly five weeks after the German government started the repatriation program, called the Corona Air Bridge.
âYou wouldnât believe how many Germans are outside the countryâs borders,â Chancellor Merkel noted in a speech to Parliament on Thursday morning, listing the repatriation efforts as a success in her governmentâs fight against the coronavirus.

The repatriation program brought home 240,000 Germans, most on scheduled commercial flights, but 66,000 were returned on a total of 260 flights chartered by the government, the German foreign ministry said. The government also brought back 6,100 European Union citizens and 3,300 nationals from other countries. 
Up to half of all 
The picture emerging from long-term care facilitates in Europe in recent weeks has been âdeeply concerning,â Hans Henri P. Kluge, the W.H.O.âs regional director for Europe, said in a news briefing.
âAccording to estimates from countries in the European Region, up to half of those who have died from Covid-19 were resident in long-term care facilities,â he said. âThis is an unimaginable human tragedy.â
Most nursing homes across Europe have banned or limited family visits to help prevent the spread of the virus, but this has deprived residents of physical and emotional support and in some cases has resulted in abuse and neglect, the organization said.
âAnd yet equally troubling â the way that such care facilities operate, how residents receive care â is providing pathways for the virus to spread,â Mr. Kluge said, adding that the pandemic had exposed overlooked and undervalued corners of society, including long-term care, which has been ânotoriously neglected.â
Almost half of coronavirus deaths in Ireland took place in nursing homes, according to Dr. Tony Holohan, the countryâs chief medical officer, who announced on Thursday that 362 of the countyâs 794 deaths were nursing home residents. But many other nations, including Britain, have not included the nursing home deaths among their daily count of fatalities. 
Chris Whitty, Englandâs chief medical officer, said on Wednesday that it was hard to prevent deaths in care homes because of the vulnerability of the age group.
Official figures published by the Office for National Statistics say there were 975 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes in England by April 10. But figures compiled by the Care Quality Commission suggest that figure could double when taking into account deaths that occurred between April 11 and April 15.
âIâm sure we will see a high mortality rate in care homes, sadly, because this is a very vulnerable group and people are coming in and out of care homes, and that cannot, to some extent, be prevented,â Mr. Whitty said.
Far more people died in 2020 during the pandemic than have been officially reported, a review of mortality data in 35 countries shows.
The Czech government on Friday eased many of the stringent restrictions put in place to stem the spread of the coronavirus, lifting a ban on travel and allowing people to move freely outside their homes in groups of no more than 10 for the first time in more than a month.
âWe believe that from the epidemiological point of view we can now ease the ban,â said Adam Vojtech, the health minister. Under restrictions put in place on March 16, Czechs could only go to work and return home and spend time outside in groups of two, with the exception of family members.
Like many other European nations, the Czech Republic swiftly locked down the country soon after its first cases were confirmed. As with neighboring nations, it is 
The government says this is partly because the country has a comparatively low number of cases, and new infections continue to fall as well. The Czech Republic reported the lowest increase in positive test results since mid-March on Thursday, with just 55 new cases, bringing the total number to 7,188. There have been 213 deaths in the country since the outbreak began.
Beginning Friday, Czech citizens can also travel abroad, though when they return they will have to show they have tested negative for the virus or go into a two-week quarantine at home. It is unclear how residents could obtain a test or who would monitor the quarantine.
Some worry that the restrictions are being lifted too soon and that the parameters for travel are unrealistic, among them Jan Papez, the vice chairman of the Czech Association of Travel Agencies.
 âThe optics are good and it looks democratic, but in reality it will not mean much,â Mr. Papez said. âHardly anybody can put themselves in a quarantine after taking holidays, and coronavirus tests are not easy to obtain commercially.â
The government is seeking to ease other restrictive measures more quickly, moving up the reopening date for restaurants, hotels, theaters and similar establishments by two weeks to May 25 from June 8. On Wednesday, the Czech Republic started an antibody study that will test 27,000 people, hoping for a clearer picture of how many people have been touched by the disease.
Hong Kong is slowly coming back to life after nearly two weeks of recording new coronavirus infections in the single digits. Thousands of high school students sat for college entrance examinations on Friday, as dozens of antigovernment protesters gathered at a shopping mall for an unrelated demonstration.
The exams had been delayed by a month, and schools in the semiautonomous Chinese territory are still closed for classes. But the test takers were permitted to enter school grounds after undergoing temperature checks and disinfection measures, and their desks were spaced farther apart than usual.
Also on Friday, a group of antigovernment demonstrators gathered â mostly at a safe distance from each other â inside a luxury mall in Hong Kongâs Central district to chant pro-democracy slogans. They were challenging Beijing days after more than a dozen pro-democracy activists and former lawmakers were

Thousands of miles from President Trumpâs combative news briefings, a conservative leader in Australia and a progressive prime minister in New Zealand are 
Australia reported its first case on Jan. 25, New Zealand on Feb. 28. But compared with Mr. Trump and leaders in Europe, Prime Ministers Scott Morrison of Australia and Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand responded with more alacrity and with starker warnings.
Both nations are now reporting just a handful of new infections each day, down from hundreds in March, and they are converging toward an extraordinary goal: completely eliminating the virus from their nations.
Whether they get to zero or not, what Australia and New Zealand have already accomplished is a remarkable cause for hope. Mr. Morrison, a conservative Christian, and Ms. Ardern, New Zealandâs darling of the left, are both succeeding with throwback democracy â in which partisanship recedes, experts lead, and quiet coordination matters more than firing up the base.
âItâs a case of politicians just not being in the way,â said Ian Mackay, an immunologist at the University of Queensland who has been involved in response planning for the pandemic. âItâs a mix of things, but I think it comes down to taking advice based on expertise.â
The prospect of a return to near normalcy in these two countries may end up being a mirage or temporary triumph: Other nations that had seemingly kept the virus at bay, like Singapore, have seen rebounds.
And yet, if there are any two countries that could pull off a clear if hermetically sealed victory â offering a model of recovery that elevates competence over ego and restores some confidence in democratic government â it may be these two sparsely populated Pacific neighbors with their history of pragmatism.
President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has extended a 
In a meeting with his advisers on Thursday night, which was aired on television Friday morning, Mr. Duterte agreed to extend an âenhanced community quarantineâ in greater Manila and some provinces until May 15.
Mr. Duterte imposed a lockdown on the island of Luzon, home to Manila and about 60 million people, in mid-March. It had been scheduled to end on April 15 and was later extended to the end of the month.
As of Thursday, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Philippines stood at almost 7,000, with total deaths nearing 500. Those tallies are among the highest in Southeast Asia.
Mr. Duterte had been falsely claiming that he was the first leader in Asia to impose a lockdown. In fact, he initially resisted the move, assuring Filipinos in February that there was nothing to be scared of.
At the meeting on Thursday, Mr. Duterte said that he might impose martial law to quell communist guerrillas, whom he accused of preying on virus-related aid convoys. He did not mention a specific incident, but earlier this week, two soldiers who were distributing cash aid to a poor community on Luzon were killed in an attack.
âI am now warning everybody and putting the police and the A.F.P. on notice,â Mr. Duterte said, referring to the Armed Forces of the Philippines. âI might declare martial law and there will be no turning back.â
The Philippine military blamed the recent attack on New Peopleâs Army, a group that has been waging a communist insurgency since the 1960s. But the group did not claim responsibility.

When Billy Chan flew home to Hong Kong from London in mid-March, he wore a disposable protective suit, goggles and an N95 mask. He changed his mask twice during the 13-hour flight, using hand sanitizer each time.

âI knew that someone might look at me and laugh,â Ms. Tan said. âItâs better than lying in the hospital, right?â
Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne disease transmission at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, said it made sense to wear protective gear on an airplane, given the tight quarters.
âI think the most important thing to do would be to wear a face covering, a mask of some sort,â said Dr. Marr, who studies how viruses spread in the air. âGoggles arenât a bad idea, especially if they will prevent you from touching your eyes.â

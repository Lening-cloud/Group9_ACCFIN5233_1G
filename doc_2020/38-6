Demi Lovato is 27, but has lived much longer. A former Disney star, and the one who consistently had the most conflicted relationship to that enterprise, she emerged in her late teenage years as a pop star with a big voice and unexpected edge. But she also struggled with addiction, and in 2018, 
Letâs have some fun, this beat is sick: There is hope for upbeat pop in 2020. The first song from a Little Dragon album due March 27 is an electro-soul benediction for an undramatic relationship set to a low simmer. The third track from Dua Lipaâs âFuture Nostalgiaâ (out April 3) cleverly threads Olivia Newton-Johnâs 1981 song âPhysicalâ through Lady Gagaâs album âThe Fame.â Itâs not as icon-clad as Lipaâs 
Torres â the singer and songwriter Mackenzie Scott â ponders the volatility of romance and the relation between life and art in âGood Scareâ from her new album, âSilver Tongue.â Booming percussion and sustained electric guitar tones give her a spacious backdrop as she observes a partner whoâs scaring her by âeyeing all the exitsâ; her reaction is to think about writing a country song. This is not one. JON PARELES
Will people learn line-dance moves from an anime? Sturgill Simpson, the insurgent roots-rocker, thinks they might. The underlying structure of âA Good Lookâ is funky blues-rock, but its sliding synthesizers and nonstop bass line make it feel machine-driven. And while Simpson is singing about all the things that compromise heartfelt songwriting â image, commerce, âyou know they donât like it when you take a standâ â the video clip is all artificial glee. Enjoy the paradox. PARELES
An earthy, uplifting tribute to Nipsey Hussle from Meek Mill with Roddy Ricch, one of Nipseyâs protÃ©gÃ©s. (They premiered it 
âOur songs were spells and our spells were plain facts,â Kate Tempest declares in âUnholy Elixir.â Sheâs more a poet than a rapper, but her recordings make the music an equal partner. âUnholy Elixirâ feels unstable but obstinate from the start, with deep, wavery, not-quite-in-tune synthesizers and a lurching beat; other synthesizer riffs arrive to turn the track into glowering synth-pop. Tempest confronts excuses for apathy â âdonât bother protesting because nobody listensâ â but warns, âYou better start sowing or there wonât be a harvest.â PARELES
Insistent, relentless six-beat patterns run nearly nonstop as Raphaelle Standell-Preston, of the Canadian band Braids, sings about lust overcoming rationality. Her âYoung Buck,â she knows, is âthe blaring example of what I am drawn towards/and should strongly move away from.â Layers of counterpoint accrue as her better judgment fades; itâs math-rock versus irresistible impulses.

Jah Wobble, the original bass player in Public Image Ltd., and other post-punk alumni â Keith Levene from the early Clash and Public Image Ltd., Mark Stewart from the Pop Group, Youth from Killing Joke â greet 
Dan Bejar, who records as Destroyer, has a fey tenor voice perfectly made for easy whimsy. But this is not a playful era, and he knows it. On his new album, âHave We Met,â the idiom he chose is the reverberant, electronics-enhanced, early MTV tone of confidence with hidden misgivings. âIt Just Doesnât Happenâ begins, âYouâre looking good/in spite of the light,â and that ambivalence persists; itâs a portrait of the artist as winner, loser and lost soul.

If Wayne Shorter is something like jazzâs Pablo Picasso â a master composer of the modern era who never abandoned tonality and form, but was constantly finding new ways to turn them upside down â then the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra works as a gilded frame to display his masterpieces. Members of the 15-piece big band, led by the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, wrote arrangements of compositions from throughout Shorterâs career, and 
An arty quartet featuring two trumpeters and two trombonists, mixing ideas from jazz, new classical and Appalachian folk, the Westerlies donât really have the option of doing a straightforward cover of most songs. Thatâs doubly true when theyâre dealing with Arthur Russell, the experimental-pop cellist and vocalist. His music is about melody and counterpoint, but itâs also about the grain of his voice, and treating sound as humid atmosphere. On this rendition of Russellâs âEli,â the Westerlies smartly lean into the tuneâs blend of harmonic splendor and hollering lament â and theyâre mindful of the need for some textural play. One of the trombonists folded tin foil across the bell of his horn, creating a restless sibilance underneath the crystal tones and rough growls of his bandmates. RUSSONELLO

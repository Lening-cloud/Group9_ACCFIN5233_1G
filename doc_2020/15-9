LONDON â She is accused of flinging a folder at an aide, hitting the staffer in the head. She reportedly told another offending underling to âget out of my faceâ and castigated her staff as âuseless,â adding an f-bomb for good measure.

But when a respected career civil servant resigned last week because of what he claimed was a âvicious and orchestratedâ campaign against him by Ms. Patel, what began as a juicy boss-from-hell story turned into a metaphor for Mr. Johnsonâs broader tensions with Britainâs much vaunted civil service.
The feud between a populist leader and an entrenched bureaucracy carries echoes of the Trump administrationâs 
In this case, the civil servant, Philip Rutnam, who served as the permanent secretary in the Home Office, said Ms. Patelâs behavior was part of a pattern of 
âCivil servants are under a lot of pressure,â said Bronwen Maddox, director of the

So far, Mr. Johnson has backed up Ms. Patel, who is a loyal political ally and a full-throated advocate for his project of leaving the European Union. As home secretary, her mandate includes overhauling Britainâs immigration system to implement a points-based system for admitting foreigners.
Among Mr. Rutnamâs offenses, people with knowledge of the situation said, was warning Ms. Patel how unrealistic it was to set up such a system in less than 10 months. While Ms. Patel has few defenders outside Mr. Johnsonâs party â and 
Moreover, Mr. Johnsonâs aides are probably not wrong to suspect that on balance, most civil servants would have preferred that Britain never left the European Union. Many are weary after serving Mr. Johnsonâs predecessor, Theresa May, who promised to deliver Brexit but went about it in a chaotic and contradictory way that sowed confusion in the bureaucracy.
âCummings is right to think itâs a problem,â said Jonathan Powell, who served as chief of staff to Prime Minister Tony Blair. âBut if he was going to get rid of them, he would have to sack the entire civil service, because in their hearts, they believe that leaving the European Union was a bad idea.â
New prime ministers, Mr. Powell said, typically come into office determined to overhaul the civil service â and they typically fail.
In 1997, Mr. Blair and his aides were convinced that after 18 years of Conservative Party rule, the civil service would be implacably hostile to his Labour Party agenda. In 1999, he complained about the âscars on my backâ from two years of battling with Britainâs public sector, a broader category that includes teachers, doctors and other public employees.
But Mr. Powell said that to his surprise, the civil service showed an almost preternatural capacity to fall in behind its new masters.
âWe thought they would be Tories,â he said. âIn fact, they bent over backward to carry out our manifesto.â
Such a lack of partisanship is one of the defining characteristics of Britainâs civil service, which encompasses roughly 450,000 people who work in the upper and middle levels of government agencies from the Treasury to the Ministry of Defense.
Chosen through a competitive exam process, civil servants pride themselves on their skill in pulling the levers of government and in offering unvarnished advice to a changing cast of politically appointed ministers.
That is a notable difference from the United States, where political appointees fill out the top ranks of most agencies. President Trump famously distrusted appointees who were held over from the Obama administration as well as high-level civil servants and moved to get rid of them.
The political agnosticism of British civil servants is so celebrated that in the popular comic TV series, âYes, Minister,â about a permanent secretary and his minister, the governmentâs party affiliation is never even mentioned.
The show, which starred Nigel Hawthorne as the civil servant Sir Humphrey Appleby, mined comic gold out of his masterful handling of his boss, portraying him as wily, quick-witted and cheerfully Machiavellian as he blocked ill-conceived projects.
âMinisters,â Sir Humphrey cracked at one point, âare like small children. They act on impulse.â
But even advocates for the civil service acknowledge its shortcomings. Along with being nonpartisan, civil servants are, by tradition, not held accountable for the performance of their departments or agencies. That can complicate their relationship with hard-driving ministers like Ms. Patel.
Defenders of Mr. Rutnam, the permanent secretary who clashed with her, said he was unflappable, honest and diligent. But others pointed to problems during his tenure at the Home Office, which became embroiled in 
Educated at Cambridge and Harvard, but virtually invisible until he went before cameras last week to deliver his emotional resignation, Mr. Rutnam was a civil servant out of central casting. 
To Mr. Cummings, that is the problem. In a blog post in January, he complained that the civil service had too many âOxbridge English graduates who chat about

Mr. Cummings also sought out â
Experts said there was merit to Mr. Cummingsâs drive for what he calls âgenuine cognitive diversity.â Martin Stanley, a former civil servant who has written extensively on the subject and 
Still, for all the furor over Ms. Patelâs clash with Mr. Rutnam, Mr. Stanley said the bigger danger was the tendency of civil servants to function as âcourtiers,â appeasing their ministers rather than challenging them. That is a difficult characteristic to root out, he said, since ministers tend to like courtiers.
Critics of Mr. Cummings said his campaign was less about encouraging intellectual ferment than enforcing doctrinal orthodoxy. Mr. Johnson triggered the resignation of his top finance minister, Sajid Javid, last month after insisting that he get rid of advisers whom he and Mr. Cummings distrusted.
The Treasury, traditionally a power center in British government, is now being largely subjugated to Mr. Johnsonâs office. There are no members of Mr. Johnsonâs cabinet who are not dedicated Brexiteers.
âBy U.K. standards,â Mr. Stanley said, âwe have an increasingly presidential setup bent on centralized command and control.â

Mr. Moss, a consultant for the London-based Asian art specialists Sydney L. Moss Ltd., pointed out that there were no comparable examples of such a large-scale Japanese sculpture from the 11th or 12th century in Western museums. Carved with the Buddhaâs right hand raised in the characteristic âFear Notâ gesture and his left holding a medicine jar, the serene figure was priced at 1.2 million pounds, or about $1.5 million.
Before the fair, three museums in the United States had been âactively enthusiastic,â about the statue, he said, but none of them came to Maastricht to see it, Mr. Moss said. Though, in this particular case, it had more to do with the clash of TEFAF Maastricht with

Christophe de Quenetain, for example, a private dealer based in Paris and London who specializes in top-of-the-range French furniture, said he spent about 300,000 euros, or $330,000, lining his booth with 8.5 tonnes of exotic marble in a design inspired the floor of the chapel at the ChÃ¢teau of Versailles.
An undisclosed American museum felt confident enough to reserve, on the basis of digital photographs, a sumptuously veneered late 17th-century bureau by Pierre Gole, cabinetmaker of Louis XIV, priced at â¬300,000 in Mr. de Quenetainâs maximalist presentation, the dealer said.

âEveryone is braced for a tough fair,â said the London-based TEFAF exhibitor Stephen Ongpin, who is showing 39 museum-quality drawings by the 19th-century German artist Adolph Menzel. âThe figures are going to be down, but I donât know anyone who isnât pleased to be here.â

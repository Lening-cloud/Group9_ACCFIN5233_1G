Books about America’s history and national identity are nothing new, but they land with particular impact around Election Day. (Or should I call it Election Week? Election 
This week we recommend four works that get to the heart of the American experiment in all its fits and starts. There’s “Bland Fanatics,” Pankaj Mishra’s essay collection urging a re-evaluation of the country’s role in the world. There’s “The Kidnapping Club,” Jonathan Daniel Wells’s history of a gang that sold New Yorkers into slavery in the decades before the Civil War. John O. Brennan’s “Undaunted” recounts his career at the highest levels of the intelligence community. And from Laila Lalami, “Conditional Citizens” traces her path to American citizenship as an Arab Muslim immigrant, and asks what it means to “belong” to a country anyway. With notions of civic duty and democratic rule on everybody’s minds right now, that might be an especially fitting book for the moment.
But maybe you get all the civic duty you can stand from the front page? In that case, we also bring you pure escapism in the form of Susanna Clarke’s new fantasy novel, Xiaolu Guo’s Brexit-themed romance and three delightful collections of literary essays by Namwali Serpell, Daniel Mendelsohn and Brian Dillon, who sings the praises of stylish prose in his book “Suppose a Sentence.” All those in favor, say “aye.”

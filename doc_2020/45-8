President Trump said yesterday that Vice President Mike Pence would coordinate the government’s response to the coronavirus. Despite mounting criticism, the president has played down the danger of a widespread U.S. outbreak, 
In an industry obsessed with blockbusters, Disney’s choice for its next C.E.O., Bob Chapek, lacks star power. Mr. Chapek, the company veteran who currently runs its theme parks and cruise ships, is largely unknown in much of Hollywood, 
• Doug McMillon, Walmart’s C.E.O., said, “Bob has always been someone we can trust to deliver on what he says.”
• Brian Cornell, Target’s chief, said Mr. Chapek had a “deep understanding of what Disney fans really love about their brand.”
The timing of the announcement feels suspicious to a lot of people. Something else 
Mr. Iger is not going anywhere for another 22 months. Full stop. He will be overseeing all of Disney’s “creative endeavors,” which is basically everything that really matters, as executive chairman. Bob Chapek essentially has training wheels on for the next two years.
Why not just elevate Mr. Chapek to chief operating officer or president, two jobs that currently don’t exist at Disney and would signal that he is the heir apparent? Because that has not worked out particularly well for Mr. Iger in the past. He chose that route for Thomas O. Staggs, who ended up leaving the company in 2016. It’s really hard to shine when you have no direct reports and a larger-than-life boss.
People also forget that Mr. Iger’s run as president of Disney under then-C.E.O. Michael Eisner was torturous at times. Mr. Iger sometimes found himself undercut by division leaders, who would go straight to Mr. Eisner. By making Mr. Chapek chief executive right out of the gate, that kind of end run is harder.

The do-it-yourself traders of r/WSB are waging a kind of guerrilla warfare in the markets, trying to exploit what they see as weaknesses in the system to move prices where they want them. For anyone who wondered about where the small day traders who made the 1990s so wild went, meet the 2020 version. After years of indifference, individual investors seem to be finding their way back to stocks, for better or worse. They’re flexing muscles in ways that can easily call to mind excesses from the dot-com era.
Many Trump administration policies are aimed at restricting immigration. But at a private event in Britain last week, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said that immigrants were

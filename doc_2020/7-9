LONDON â Russia has mounted a prolonged, sophisticated campaign to undermine Britainâs democracy and corrupt its politics, while successive British governments have looked the other way, according to a long-delayed report released on Tuesday by a British parliamentary committee.
From meddling in elections and spreading disinformation to funneling dirty money and employing members of the House of Lords, the Russians have tried to co-opt politicians and corrode institutions, often with little resistance from law enforcement or intelligence agencies that ignored years of warning signs.
The report, in many ways harder on British officials than the Russians, did not answer the question of whether Russia swayed one of the most consequential votes in modern British history: the 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. But it was unforgiving about who is protecting British democracy.
âNo one is,â the reportâs authors said.
âThe outrage isnât if there is interference,â said Kevan Jones, a Labour Party member of Parliament who served on the intelligence committee that released the report. âThe outrage is no one wanted to know if there was interference.â
The release of the report came more than seven months after Prime Minister Boris Johnsonâs Conservative Party 
Still, it was eagerly awaited in Britain, where anxieties about Russiaâs behavior range from 
The report also landed in the heat of an American presidential election, 
The committeeâs account characterized Russia as a reckless country bent on recapturing its status as a âgreat power,â primarily by destabilizing those in the West. âThe security threat posed by Russia is difficult for the West to manage as, in our view and that of many others, it appears fundamentally nihilistic,â the authors said.
Experts said the report showed parallels between Britain and the United States in the failure to pick up warning signs, but also important differences. The F.B.I. and other American agencies, they said, had investigated election interference more aggressively than their British counterparts, while the British were ahead of the United States in scrutinizing how Russian money had corrupted politics.
âThis is one of the pieces that is not really well understood in the U.S.,â said Laura Rosenberger, director of the 
The report described how British politicians had welcomed oligarchs to London, allowing them to launder their illicit money through what it called the London âlaundromat.â A growth industry of âenablersâ â lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and public relations consultants â sprang up to serve their needs.
These people, the report said, âplayed a role, wittingly or unwittingly, in the extension of Russian influence which is often linked to promoting the nefarious interests of the Russian state.â
Several members of the House of Lords, the report said, had business interests linked to Russia or worked for companies with Russian ties. It urged an investigation of them, though it did not name any names. That information, as well as the names of politicians who received donations, was redacted from the public report, along with other sensitive intelligence.
âThe most disturbing thing is the recognition of what the Russian government has gotten away, under our eyes,â said 
The report painted a picture of years of Russian interference through disinformation spread by traditional media outlets, like the cable-TV channel RT, and by the use of internet bots and trolls. This activity dated back to the 
Focused more on clandestine operations, the spy agencies were anxious to keep their distance from political campaigns, regarding them as a âhot potato,â the report said. Nor was it clear who in the government was in charge of countering the Russian threat to destabilize Britainâs political process. âIt has been surprisingly difficult to establish who has responsibility for what,â the report said.
Despite pressing questions, the report said the government had shown little interest in investigating whether the Brexit referendum was targeted by Russia. The government responded that it had âseen no evidence of successful interference in the E.U. referendumâ and dismissed the need for further investigation.
But the committee suggested that the reason no evidence had been uncovered was because nobody had looked for it.
âIn response to our request for written evidence at the outset of the inquiry, MI5 initially provided just six lines of text,â the committee said. Had the intelligence agencies conducted a threat assessment before the vote, it added, it was âinconceivableâ that they would not have concluded there was a Russian threat.
Among the reportâs most politically salient conclusions might be about a Russian influence campaign during the Scottish independence referendum. Nationalist sentiment is surging again in Scotland, partly because many voters consider the Scottish authorities to have handled the coronavirus pandemic better than the government in England. Based on its previous behavior, some experts said, Russia would try again to encourage the fracturing of the United Kingdom.
âThat obviously has implications for next yearâs Scottish elections, and the polling on referendums,â said 
Concerns about Russian meddling and aggression stretch back more than a decade to the death in 2006 of 
In 2018, another former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury, after a poisoning attack that left them hospitalized for weeks. Britain accused two Russians of using a rare nerve agent to try to kill Mr. Skripal, and 
Although the report was approved by Downing Street in 2019, its release was held up before the election that gave Mr. Johnson his decisive parliamentary majority. Critics said he had been compromised by donations to his party from wealthy Russians living in Britain and they argued that the report was delayed unnecessarily.
After the election, there was a second delay while Downing Street agreed on the membership of a new Intelligence and Security Committee.
While the publicly available part of the report unearthed little new material, one expert said that it underscored the need to widen the focus and improve the coordination of Britainâs intelligence apparatus.
âWe did know most of this,â said Martin Innes, director of the 
âWhat Russia wants is to be able to play great power politics,â Professor Innes said. âAnd one of the ways of doing that is by destabilizing the U.K. and some of its close allies to create that space to maneuver.â

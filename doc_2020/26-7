LONDON â David Hockneyâs 1966 Pop Art masterwork âThe Splashâ sold on Tuesday night, much as expected, for 23.1 million pounds, or about $29.8 million, with fees, at a Sothebyâs auction of contemporary art overshadowed by 
The work, the star lot at the auction, is one of three painted versions of Mr. Hockneyâs celebrated image of the spray thrown up by an unseen diver who has just plunged into the blue of a California swimming pool. The best-known of those images is the monumental 1967 canvas, âA Bigger Splash,â in the Tate collection in London.
This medium-size version, measuring 6 feet along each side, was being sold by the Chinese real estate billionaire Joseph Lau, according to 
The Hockney sold to a single telephone bid. It was the third-highest auction price yet achieved for one of the painterâs works, but it was still well behind 
âThe Hockney was a bit disappointing as a spectacle, but it has to be put in the context of whatâs happening at the moment in Asia,â said Brett Gorvy, co-founder of LÃ©vy Gorvy, an art dealership with galleries in London and New York.

At the post-sale news conference, Alex Branczik, Sothebyâs head of contemporary art in Europe, said that the auction had been âvery much business as usual,â with the number of Asian clients registered to bid in line with other recent sales. Eight out the nightâs 43 sold works went to buyers from Asia, he added.
But dealers noted that at the auction itself, bidding was dominated by specialists based in Europe and the United States.
âI wouldnât imagine there were that many Chinese bids. Theyâre normally the people backing this market to the hilt,â said James Butterwick, a London-based dealer, who bought the 1985 Jean-Michel Basquiat painting, âRubber,â for an unnamed Russian collector for Â£7.5 million, within the estimate. âItâs a smart time for my client to buy.â

There was genuine confusion. Even low-level rage.
âPlease, please, please change the inflection, speed, and delivery of your closing intro: âHereâs what else you need to know today,ââ wrote 
In my mind, the words were crystal clear. For everybody else, not so much.
Even listeners who could discern them seemed amused by the pronunciation. They took mischievous stabs at spelling out the final offending words.

Hereâs the reality: I just say it weirdly. The word âto,â the word âknowâ and the word âtodayâ are elided into a messy tangle.

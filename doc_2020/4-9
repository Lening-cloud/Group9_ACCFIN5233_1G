LONDON â An image from my sepia-toned memory in the 1950s: by a summery wheat field freckled with poppies in northern France, English vacationers have halted for tea. A man primes a hand-cranked paraffin stove. A battered kettle is produced, and a teapot. Driving by in their bouncy CitroÃ«n 2CVs and curvy Renault Dauphines, French motorists observe the ritual with tolerant bemusement or haughty disdain. British travelers, a rarity then, wave when they spot a kindred license plate.
It is often said â especially now that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has struck a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union â that Britainâs desire to leave the European Union is rooted in nostalgia, a hankering for the past glories of a bulldog nation. The sloganeering imagery of striking out alone, â
Indeed, with much of the land in near lockdown, confronted by a mutant and 
This week, it almost seemed as if the two had combined. Alarmed by the new variant of the virus in Britain, 
Thousands of trucks â stranded in Britain as Christmas and a deadline to seal a Brexit trade deal drew close â 
It might be a clichÃ©, but it was tempting to compare events to a perfect storm: Just as Britain was about to bid farewell to the European Union, Covid-19 had left it isolated from the world. The chaos of trucks stuck on British highways and at a former airfield in the surrounding countryside in Kent seemed to offer 
Against such momentous upheaval, that small vignette from northern France so many years ago, when the memory of global conflict was still vivid, spoke to a different yearning.
The poppies, of course, evoked the dead of World War I, but stood for renewal after World War II. And, in its modest way, the tea-brewing family (my own) venturing onto the âContinentâ in the late 1950s was part of the cautious vanguard of rapprochement that led, in January 1973, to Britainâs membership of what was then called the European Community, confirmed by a referendum two years later.
Like that first ballot, 
In the four years of fraught negotiation and politicking since then, the division has not eased. âLeaveâ became a mantra in a near-mystical evocation of Britain, as it was in the colonial era, roaming the far-flung oceans in quest of trade and prosperity, in control of its destiny, free of outsidersâ trammels. The novelist David Cornwell, who wrote under the name John le CarrÃ© 
Yet âRemain,â too, was a siren call from a more recent past of stability and prosperity, free movement and cosmopolitanism. In saying they seek to look forward, both sides, it sometimes seems, are looking back â and past one another â with equal chromatic distortion in their rose-colored spectacles.
On the plus side for the Remain camp, European Union membership came with any number of luxuries, like the little blue European Health Insurance Card giving Britons health care access to state providers in 27 countries; 
There will be other costs, the Remainers and others argue, like the shrinking of Britainâs economy and questions about the lacunae in the latest agreement, most notably 
When I look back to the days by the poppy-fields of northern France, I recall that we had needed a document called a carnet to get the parental Austin A40 across Europeâs myriad borders; coupons to buy gas in France; travelerâs checks to convert into the francs and D-marks and Italian lire and all the other currencies that preceded the single euro currency.
And when I thumb through old passports from the 1970s, with their thick, navy blue, pasteboard covers, I see the pages recording the exchange control regulations that tallied my foreign currency dealings, part of the web of cumbersome paperwork that is about to be rebuilt around what had become ever-smoother travel to and within the Continent. Then there are the entry visas marking arrivals and departures in Belgium, Switzerland and other places that no longer require such formalities from British travelers.
But what had perhaps been only vaguely glimpsed beyond the bare-knuckled campaigning for the 2016 Brexit referendum was the enormous complexity and national division that would flow from the prospect of disconnecting Britain from Europeâs web of bonds and animosities, rivalries and alliances.
At its core, Brexit represents a triumph for those within the Conservative Party who have fundamentally changed the nationâs calculations of where its interests lie, a triumph over the pragmatism for which Britons once prized themselves.
It is a tectonic shift that has largely ignored the sentiments of the voters who formed what Leavers mocked as the Remoaners. Already it has amplified the centrifugal forces tugging at the component elements of the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland, which voted to remain in the European Union and where 
As much as anything, this collision of Covid-19 and Brexit has reaffirmed the most self-congratulatory passions of British exceptionalism. Prime Minister Johnson routinely refers to British science as world-beating, even though the country has logged Europeâs second-highest Covid-19 death toll after Italy. A British government minister spoke of his country as simply better than the rest of world, largely because it had been the first to approve the rollout of vaccines that were developed in Germany and manufactured in Belgium.
âWeâve got the very best people in this country and weâve obviously got the best medical regulators,â said 
In this twilight of Britainâs membership in the most successful of postwar trading blocs, no assessment can avoid a reference to the credentials of whoever is making it.
Mine is colored by many years looking at Britain from the outside yet living a European identity. During many years overseas in Africa, Europe and the Middle East, I lived at various times in Switzerland, Germany, Greece, Italy and France. I traveled the continent, from the icy efficiency of its northernmost outposts on the Baltic to the sunlight of the Mediterranean and the bloodletting of the Balkans. I enjoyed the fact that my European identity was emblazoned on 
Prime Minister Johnson and his supporters are hoping that the overriding sentiment conjured by the deal among Britons will be relief. More ominously though, opinion surveys have yielded stubborn evidence that many Britons cleave to the views they expressed during the referendum fight in 2016, suggesting that the nationâs divisions have not been resolved. The choices of 2016 are no longer on the table. With its decoupling from the European Union, Britain has signaled a profound shift not only in its relationship with Brussels but also in the way the rest of the world regards the European project.
âThis moment marks the end of a long voyage,â said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the blocâs executive arm. Like the journey through the poppy fields of northern France those decades ago, it was also a new, untested foray into the unknown.

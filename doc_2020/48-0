But, he added, âI think we have to recognize that for most of our history, our institutions were explicitly racist.â
With summer tourist season approaching, leaders in Western Europe are embracing 
Italy and Germany, for example, are reopening more widely. Others â like Switzerland, Denmark and the Baltic States â are opting for âtravel bubbles,â a selective list of countries from which travelers can enter.

You have to be willing to get a bit uncomfortable in pursuit of actually documenting the reality, the truth, of a situation.
Youâre going to have many people there who are suffering trauma, who are perhaps distrustful of the news media, and I think one thing I needed to accept was getting over that wall of going to someone who didnât want to speak to me and convincing them to.
Being a black journalist, Iâm going to come to the situation with a perspective and a background that other reporters may not have. I think that approaching these situations with that perspective can actually get at one of the more crucial necessities when it comes to this reporting, which is empathy â to have the ability to understand, not just transcribe, where a person who is experiencing the trauma of the situation could be coming from.
I have to acknowledge that there have been documented reports of abuses of authority and violent incidents. I think itâs ever more important to be present to this situation in order to document any of those incidents against anybody.
But speaking generally, thereâs that clichÃ© that reporting is documenting the first draft of history. Protests are the early seeds of a movement that could shape the future of this country, that could determine policy change, that could determine who will be in power. But at the very root of it, it also shows the mind-set and the feelings of the people in this country right now. This really is the root of our reporting. This is a prime example of why we do what we do.
Thatâs it for this briefing. See you next time.

Here’s what the report shows about the state of the Trump Organization — and the enormous financial and legal pressures Mr. Trump faces.
• Those reported losses were used to offset profits from Mr. Trump’s brand-licensing business, which netted $427 million from 2004 to 2018. Other moneymakers include Trump Tower and a 30 percent stake in two office towers run by Vornado.

The Tesla C.E.O. sat down with our Times Opinion colleague Kara Swisher for the latest episode of her new podcast, Sway, out this morning. The riveting conversation ranges from his company’s stratospheric stock price to the end of the world. Find the highlights below — and 
Mr. Musk remains noncommittal about how he intends to vote: “Let’s just see how the debates go.” But he told Kara that climate change — which he has called the planet’s biggest threat — is on his mind: “I want to see if Biden has it together. If he does, he probably wins.”
He noted that he had described it as “a bit high,” well before where it’s trading now. (It closed at $407.34 on Friday.) But he added, “Do I think Tesla will be worth more than this in five years? I think the answer is yes.”
He said that the end of vehicles relying on fossil fuels is near, but also expressed sympathy for the industry’s workers: “For a lot of the people in the oil and gas industry, especially if they’re on the older side, they kind of bought their companies and did their work before it was clear that this was a serious issue.”

Before the first presidential debate, Steve Ballmer, the billionaire former C.E.O. of Microsoft and current owner of the L.A. Clippers, is introducing a 
Here are excerpts from Andrew’s conversation with Mr. Ballmer from late last week.
People are going to spend all this money on political advertising, candidates, blah blah blah, and I just said, “Look, we’ve got to put some money into data in politics.” We’ve got to tell people there’s data there, data that you can act on. In a way, it’s the weirdest thing I’ve ever done.
I found this quote that I think is one of the great quotes of all times: “A popular government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps both.” That’s James Madison from the founding of this country, essentially saying you’ve got to give people the facts.
A business would ask: Can we re-engineer the process of data collection? Can we agree on a standard taxonomy for police and criminal justice data from the states, and just standardize the reporting? That is not a high-expense thing. There’s a one-time conversion cost. Are we going to do that?

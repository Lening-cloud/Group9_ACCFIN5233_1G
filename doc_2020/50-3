The past few days have seen a flurry of tech companies file to go public, taking advantage of investors’ hunger for high-growth, high-tech businesses in an increasingly digital world — a shift accelerated by the pandemic. Here’s what to know about some of the most important offerings in the pipeline:
• Unlike other tech companies that harvest and monetize user data, a major part of Palantir’s business is selling software to governments with a mission to “to target terrorists and to keep soldiers safe,” he wrote. The company has “chosen sides,” Mr. Karp noted, and does not do business with any “adversaries” of the U.S. (read: China).
• Palantir still resembles its Silicon Valley brethren in important ways, and not just because it’s losing money. It plans to go public with several classes of shares, including “Class F” stock that give its founders — Mr. Karp, Stephen Cohen and the billionaire Peter Thiel — precisely 49.999999 percent of votes regardless of how many shares they own. Such ironclad control for founders is very on-trend for the Valley.

A few weeks ago, I told you not to panic about the coronavirus. No, thatâs putting it too mildly. In the big, screaming urgency of a New York Times headline, I all but commanded you not to panic about the novel virus threatening to spread across the globe.
To be totally fair to myself, my reasoning 
Events have not exactly been kind to my thesis. I still think mass panic is a grave threat, but now that the number of 
Now, Iâve been a pundit for a long time, and I learned early on not to sweat being occasionally wrong about the future. I figure if Iâm not wrong sometimes, Iâm probably thinking too small. What I do regret about my virus column, though, is its dripping certainty. I wasnât just pooh-poohing the virusâs threat; using the history of two other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, as my guide, I all but guaranteed that this one, too, would more or less fizzle out.
In retrospect, my analytical mistake is obvious, and itâs a type of error that has become all too common across media, especially commentary on television and Twitter. My mistake was that I hadnât properly accounted for what statisticians call 
A projection of certainty is often a crucial part of commentary; nobody wants to listen to a wishy-washy pundit. But I worry that unwarranted certainty, and an under-appreciation of the unknown, might be our collective downfall, because it blinds us to a new dynamic governing humanity: The world is 
Yes, the future is always unknowable. But thereâs reason to believe itâs becoming even more so, because when it comes to affairs involving masses of human beings â which is most things, from politics to markets to religion to art and entertainment â a range of forces is altering society in fundamental ways. These forces are easy to describe as Davos-type grand concepts: among others, the internet, smartphones, social networks, the globalization and interdependence of supply chains and manufacturing, the internationalization of culture, unprecedented levels of travel, urbanization and climate change. But their effects are not discrete. They overlap and intertwine in nonlinear ways, leaving chaos in their wake.
In the last couple of decades, the world has become unmoored, crazier, somehow messier. The black swans are circling; chaos monkeys have been unleashed. And whether weâre talking about the election, the economy, or most any other corner of humanity, we in the pundit class would do well more often to strike a note of humility in the face of the expanding unknown. We ought to add a disclaimer to everything we say: âI could be wrong! We all could be wrong!â
Since I donât expect many of my commentating colleagues to do so, itâs best for you in the audience to remember this the next time you watch, say, veteran 
I should note that there is some 
More than that, the growing unpredictability of human affairs is clear in the number of surprises we seem to be enduring lately. What was the 2008 financial crisis if not an out-of-the-blue event that stymied most prognosticators? Or, for that matter, the election of the first African-American president, Americaâs hyper-fast flip on gay rights, Brexit, Trumpâs election, or the rise of Bernie Sanders?
And, sticking with politics, 
Iâll lay my cards on the table: To me, Sanders is looking increasingly electable, the virus looks like it could reshape much of daily life at least in the short term, and the Trump administrationâs response to it is bound to be bumbling and perhaps extremely scary.
Of course, I could be wrong. We all could be.

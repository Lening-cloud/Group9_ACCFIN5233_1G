Twenty years ago, on Feb. 4, 2000, a shock wave reverberated from the heart of Europe: The far-right Freedom Party of Austria, founded in 1956 by National Socialist activists, entered government. Led by 
After months of negotiation with the conservative Peopleâs Party, the Freedom Party was asked to join a governing coalition. âThis is the first time an anti-European, xenophobic party with a very dubious relationship toward the Nazi past has come into the government of a member state,â Germanyâs foreign minister, 
It was certainly a shock. After the war, European electorates had grown comfortable choosing alternate governments of the center left and center right during the second half of the 20th century. Their leaders believed the Austrian experience to be an aberration and looked to make an example of the country. Members of the European Parliament declared en masse that the Freedom Partyâs admission into a coalition government â
International condemnation was swift. The European Unionâs 14 other nations bilaterally ended cultural exchange and joint military exercises, and the United States and Israel recalled their ambassadors from Vienna. Figures ranging from Prince Charles to the musician Lou Reed canceled planned appearances. By mid-February 2000, when Mr. Haider 
But in 2017, when Mr. Haiderâs Freedom Party successor, Heinz-Christian Strache, scored a similar general election result and the party was once again invited into a ruling alliance, there was little attempt to ostracize the country. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany moved quickly to welcome the new Austrian government, led by the 31-year-old conservative 
The Freedom Party was gifted the foreign, interior and defense departments, and Mr. Strache â who denigrated Islam as âfascisticâ and as a young man had been arrested at a torch-lit neo-Nazi procession in Germany â took control of the office of vice chancellor. The coalition agreement was fittingly announced at Kahlenberg, the site of the Battle of Vienna, which resulted in the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in 1683. Crowds gathering in the Austrian capital to oppose the new government were a fraction of those who came out nearly two decades earlier, when protests were so severe that the new cabinet could only enter and exit the inauguration ceremony through hidden underground passageways.
The story of Austria in the 21st century is, in part, the story of the wider European project. Once, the far right was anathema. Now it is routine. Born outside the mainstream, its parties now operate as a powerful political force, pushing public debate and often government policy across the continent.
How did this happen?
The far rightâs rise ultimately emerges from a crisis of the political center. Politicians tasked with stabilizing the Continent after the global financial crash of 2007-08 became adept at turning the political narrative away from their own culpability. Europeâs leaders found themselves re-evaluating the benefits of historic migration into their countries â forever initiating debates on ânational identityâ (Nicolas Sarkozy of France), rejecting the âmultiethnicâ makeup of nation-states (Silvio Berlusconi of Italy) and proclaiming multiculturalism dead (Angela Merkel of Germany and David Cameron of Britain).
The case of France is instructive. Mr. Sarkozy â the single-term French president from 2007 who announced that his country did not want immigration âinflictedâ on itself â was the perfect foil for an insurgent Front National. In 2011, at the partyâs compound in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre, 
So it proved. Ms. Le Penâs far-right party successfully displaced the traditional conservatives (and dwarfed the incumbent Socialists) to make the presidential runoff in 2017. Though ultimately defeated by Mr. Macron, she still attracted 
The taboo on the far right in government has been comprehensively broken: Mainstream parties appear happy to cooperate with those once considered âtoxic.â Nativist representatives have been invited into ruling coalitions in Denmark, Finland, Italy and the Netherlands to act as support partners for traditional conservatives unable to win parliamentary majorities. No longer derided or dismissed by their mainstream rivals, far-right parties now show themselves capable of winning nationwide elections. Last year Franceâs National Rally, Italyâs League and Britainâs Brexit Party won the most votes in their countriesâ elections to the European Parliament.
But far-right parties donât need to win elections to see their agenda carried out. After the financial crisis, the governments of Europe almost universally adopted bullish positions on immigration, binding the issue with concerns around security, crime and benefits spending. In an age of austerity, âNatives Firstâ policies are widely seen as economic common sense, championed by everyone from Denmarkâs Social Democratic prime minister, 
Mr. Haider died in a 2008 car accident in Carinthia, the province where he had been governor for nearly a decade. In 2019, Mr. Strache, embroiled in a corruption scandal, was forced to step down as Austrian vice chancellor and was subsequently expelled from the Freedom Party. Yet their messages â politically anti-establishment, culturally anti-immigrant and anti-Islam â remain popular, permeating through Europe.
Now no country is immune from hearing, in the words of the historian Tony Judt, the far rightâs âone long scream of resentmentâ â even those with brutal memories of a fascist past. Unthinkable only a decade ago, both the anti-immigrant 
The European Union, built on the twin creeds of social democracy and Christian democracy, has now been forced to accommodate a third assertive ideology: nativist populism. For the first time in history, the mainstream left and right combined no longer hold a majority in the 
What began in Austria, 20 years ago, is far from finished.

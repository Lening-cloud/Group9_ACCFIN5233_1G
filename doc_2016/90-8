Stars Hollow, Conn., would make a great âTwilight Zoneâ setting.
There is something unearthly about the adorable little town. The people are eccentric and hale and smiley â maybe too smiley. It feels cut off from the world â you can barely even get a cellular signal â as if, in the words of Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), âThe entire town was constructed in a giant snow globe.â
But 
Thereâs always the danger, with cultural nostalgia, that sweetness can tip over into something uncanny and eerie. Thereâs a fine line between celebrating the past and exhuming it.
âGilmore Girls: A Year in the Lifeâ stays, mostly, on the good side of that line. So many things are much like we remember them: Miss Pattyâs ballet studio, the Sam Phillips âla la laâs on the soundtrack, the troubadour in the town square. But it really works because, for all its winks and callbacks and 
âA Year in the Lifeâ was conceived as a kind of do-over. The creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, left the original series after six seasons (along with her husband and writing partner, Daniel Palladino) in a contract dispute. âGilmore Girlsâ sputtered on for one tongue-tied final season, but Ms. Sherman-Palladino wasnât there to execute the ending that she had planned down to the seriesâ last four words.
Though the mini-series does end on those four words, âA Year in the Lifeâ is not, and canât be, the final season we never got.
The biggest reminder is a change forced on the show: Edward Herrmann, who played the patriarch Richard Gilmore, 
âA Year in the Lifeâ begins in early 2016, four months after Richardâs death, which has resurfaced bitter feelings between Lorelai and Emily. Rory, now a peripatetic journalist, comes home to figure herself out, see old friends and walk and talk with her mother through the townâs tourism-brochure-perfect snowscape.
On the surface, little has changed. Luke Danes (Scott Patterson), Lorelaiâs old squeeze, is still haranguing the customers at his diner, though now over Wi-Fi abuse rather than cellphone use. The pop-culture references still fly, updated to include âGame of Thrones,â âOutlanderâ and man buns.
But Rory is 32 now, the same age as Lorelai when the series began in 2000. (On one level, the entire mini-series is a âWanna Feel Old?â listicle.) This is a time-conscious story, down to the structure â four feature-length episodes, one for each season. Rory is feeling her age; Lorelai is feeling her mortality; Emily is feeling both heartbreak and the opportunity to change.
The mini-series is sentimental but not maudlin, and Ms. Graham and Ms. Bledel quickly fall back into their Tracy-Hepburn comedic rhythm. âWow. Iâm winded,â Rory says after their first verbal tap dance. âHavenât done that for a while,â Lorelai answers.
Thereâs more of that self-consciousness, and a parade of âWell hello, you!â cameos. You will likely be indulged no matter whom you consider the best supporting character. (The correct answer, by the way, is Paris Geller, Roryâs former classmate played by Liza Weil, who gets an update that shows off her brittle imperiousness.)
âA Year in the Lifeâ plays like a six-hour movie in four acts. The format establishes it, like 
But thereâs some bloat, including a âWaiting for Guffmanâ-like community musical interlude, featuring Christian Borle and Sutton Foster, that runs 10 minutes and would have been better at 10 seconds. And elements of Roryâs plot feel like they were intended more for a character in her early 20s â as Ms. Sherman-Palladino originally planned â than one in her early 30s.
Mostly, though, âA Year in the Lifeâ succeeds at recreating the voice of âGilmore Girls,â which is what creates the world of âGilmore Girls.â
Like Lake Wobegon or Mayberry, Stars Hollow is a wish in the shape of a town, an idyll where everything is low stakes. Townspeople argue, but mostly over things like an international food fair or a proposed sewer system. They have decent, not overly demanding jobs, blue collar and white. Young adults who fail to launch can come home to their parentsâ cozy houses (a running joke in one episode). Stars Hollow is not just a safety net, itâs a giant, fluffy featherbed.
This is an eternal fantasy, but itâs well timed for the Thanksgiving weekend after an election that has made fractious Emilys and Lorelais of many relatives. (There are few political references beyond a quick allusion to âBrexit,â but itâs noteworthy that the story wraps in the fall, just as real America is about to head off to the polls.)
In that sense, there

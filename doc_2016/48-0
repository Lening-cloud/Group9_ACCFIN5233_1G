LONDON â Shareholders in the London Stock Exchange Group approved on Monday plans to merge with Deutsche BÃ¶rse in an all-stock deal that the stock exchange operators hope will create a European champion in the industry.
The approval came about a week and a half after 
The surprising outcome of the referendum led to questions about whether the merger could be completed under its current terms, and in particular whether the combined entityâs holding company would be based in Britain, as planned.
The exchanges, however, said they would press ahead.
Last week, the head of BaFin, the German financial regulator, questioned whether the combined business could be based in Britain given the outcome of the referendum. Some German investors have also called for the companies to re-evaluate their plans in light of the vote, and to move the holding companyâs base elsewhere in the European Union.
Investors in the German exchange have until July 12 to accept an offer to exchange their Deutsche BÃ¶rse stock for shares in a new holding company for the combined entity, which the companies have said would have headquarters in both London and Frankfurt and be based in Britain. At least 75 percent of Deutsche BÃ¶rseâs outstanding shares must be tendered in the offer for the deal to be successful.
âI strongly endorse the statement of London Stock Exchange Group following their general meeting today and continue to recommend the transaction to the shareholders of Deutsche BÃ¶rse,â Joachim Faber, the Deutsche BÃ¶rse chairman, 
On Monday, shareholders representing 99.89 percent of the London Stock Exchange Groupâs outstanding shares voted in favor of the deal.
The exchangesâ boards have formed a referendum committee to make recommendations to the board of the combined group âin order to meet all regulatory requirements to secure closing of the transaction and achieve its commercial objectives.â
The committeeâs work may take âmany months,â the companies said.

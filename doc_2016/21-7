BRUSSELS â Shaken by Britainâs vote to quit the European Union, the blocâs leaders met on Tuesday in Brussels and sent a blunt message to Britain and others tempted to follow its example: Bolting will carry a heavy price.
While softening demands that Britain formally file for divorce swiftly following last Thursdayâs shocking referendum result, leaders of the European Unionâs 27 other nations made it clear to Prime Minister David Cameron that his country would not enjoy the benefits of membership â like access to Europeâs single market â while sloughing off its burdens.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, speaking at a late-night news conference, took a hard position, saying that her country would defend its economic priorities and that Britain must use an agreed legal procedure to leave the European Union.
âThe discussion today reflected very clearly that everyone felt this was a sea change, a watershed moment, a historic moment,â Mrs. Merkel said. The goal was to reshape the relationship with Britain âas a relationship of friendship,â she said, but âwe will also be guided by our own interests.â
Referring to the 
Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands, historically one of Britainâs closest allies in pushing Europe to focus on strengthening market forces and protecting sovereign rights, said the economic and political mayhem caused by Britainâs vote to leave should deter others.
âTo everybody thinking of leaving the single market, this is what happens,â he said.
The turmoil has stirred hope in some quarters that Britain might, in the end, never take the next, formal step to leave the European Union. Ms. Merkel, however, dismissed this as âimpossible.â
As to whether Britain could hold another referendum with a different outcome, she said that was highly unlikely. âAs of tonight I do not see any possibility to reverse this decision,â she said. âIt is not the hour for wishful thinking.â

(SOUNDBITE) (English) EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT, JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, SAYING (SPEAKING OVER SHOTS OF MEPS AND SCHULZ):
âThat is the last time that you are applauding here. And to some extent, Iâm really surprised that you are here. You are fighting for the exit, the British people voted in favour of the exit , why are you here?â

(SOUNDBITE) (English) LEADER OF THE EUROPEAN PEOPLEâS PARTY, MANFRED WEBER, SAYING:
âWe say, our message today is: the young generation of the United Kingdom can continue to trust in their friends in Europe, we donât leave you on your own.â
Mr. Cameron, attending what will probably be his last European summit meeting in Brussels, also stressed that there was no turning back from last weekâs vote in favor of Brexit, as Britainâs withdrawal from the union is known.
âI am sorry we lost the referendum but you have to accept the result of the British people, you have to accept the verdict,â he told reporters. âIâm a democrat.â
While calling for âthe closest possible relationshipâ with Europe in the future, he acknowledged that âit is impossible to have all of the benefits of membership without some of the costs of membership.â
Mr. Cameron, who has said he will resign by October, has left the task of setting the terms of the departure settlement to his successor, who will be responsible for invoking an exit clause, Article 50, in a European treaty and starting negotiations with Brussels on disentangling a formal relationship that began in 1973.

SOUNDBITE (English) Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish First Minister:
âNow like all of us, I hope very much that we will see an early return of stability and some confidence. However, I do fear that we are still in the early days of this period of risk and uncertainty.â

 SOUNDBITE (English) Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish First Minister
âPoliticians who proposed this referendum, no matter how bruised they feel by the result, have a duty now to step up to deal with the consequences of its outcome and those who campaigned for a âLeaveâ vote, making a number of promises in the process, must now be clear and honest about their plans to deliver.â

SOUNDBITE (English) Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish First Minister
âThere cannot be three months of drift now while both the government and main opposition parties at Westminster immerse themselves in eternal elections. That would compound the difficult situation weâre already facing and risk even more damage to our economy.â

âTomorrow I will make an initial visit to Brussels to set out Scotlandâs position and interests to representatives of the major groups of the European Parliament and to the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz. I expect to hear from the Prime Minister on the outcome of the European Council taking place this week, and following that I intend to set out Scotlandâs position directly to the European Commission.â

SOUNDBITE (English) Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish First Minister
âDuring the (Scottish) independence referendum we were told that staying in the UK meant we could benefit from having guaranteed access to the EU. Indeed that was a driving factor in many peopleâs votes. That is no longer true. The country and the constitutional settlement the people of Scotland voted for in 2014 is no longer a reality. Based on the very clear result in Scotland, if we were to be removed from the EU it would be against the will of our people. That would be democratically unacceptable. It is for that reason that I have said that everything must be on the table to protect our place in Europe, including a second independence referendum and to ensure the option of holding a referendum, within the time frame of UK negotiations on leaving the EU is viable, we will prepare the legislation now.â
France and other countries have complained that this would only create months of uncertainty and stoke unease for financial markets. But there seemed to be more sympathy on Tuesday for Britainâs hesitant pace. âIf they need more time we have to wait. This is the only legal way we have,â Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents European governments, told reporters.
Beyond dealing with the mechanics of Britainâs exit, however, European Union members face an even tougher challenge in trying to dampen rising populist sentiment elsewhere, while somehow rebuilding the cornerstone of Europeâs peace and relative prosperity for more than 60 years.
How to do this will be the focus of the second day of the summit meeting on Wednesday â from which Mr. Cameron is excluded.
The shock vote in Britain has done more than embolden populists who denounce the European Union as a distant and meddling force. It has resurfaced deep bitterness and anger left by earlier crises, notably a grinding economic slowdown and an uncontrolled influx of migrants across Europeâs open borders.
The British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.
Instead of dealing with just the crisis of confidence set off by the vote for Brexit, leaders are effectively confronting all the crises of recent years at one time. Still unresolved are arguments over austerity, the German-led prescription for a financial crisis that began in Greece in 2008, and whether the European Union should be merely a free-trade zone or the locomotive of a more ambitious program of âever closer union,â a cause enshrined in the 1957 Treaty of Rome.
Arriving for the summit meeting, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece â whose country voted in a referendum last year to reject a financial bailout offered by Brussels only to accept even harsher terms to avoid expulsion from Europeâs common currency â described the British referendum result as a âsad wake-up callâ that should force the European Union to abandon policies of austerity and âendless negotiations behind closed doors.â
At the European Parliament early on Tuesday, a debate on Britainâs referendum result produced raucous scenes as Nigel Farage, a British member of the assembly and a driving force behind the Brexit campaign, traded insults and mockery with fellow legislators and the president of the European Commission, the blocâs executive arm, Jean-Claude Juncker, who demanded to know: âWhy are you here?â
Mindful that Europeâs identity crisis is unlikely to be settled anytime soon, the leaders of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia urged the European Union to âget back to basicsâ and focus on reinforcing freedoms and building a single market.
Britainâs financial and military connections to the rest of Europe.
âInstead of endless theoretical debates on âmore Europeâ or âless Europeâ we need to focus on âbetter Europe,ââ the leaders of the four countries, all formerly communist, said in a statement.
What this âbetter Europeâ â a popular slogan now used by politicians who agree on little else â would look like exactly is unclear. What is clear, however, is that skepticism over the European Union as it works now is on the rise.
A spring survey by the 
Positive views of the European Union fell, often substantially, in five of the six countries surveyed by Pew in both 2015 and 2016. Even Germany, where strong support for the so-called European project had been an unwavering feature of postwar politics, euroskepticism is on the rise, with 48 percent of those polled saying they had an unfavorable view of the bloc.
Speaking as he arrived for the summit meeting, President FranÃ§ois Hollande of France said the situation today in the United Kingdom, with political turmoil, a plunging currency and credit rating downgrades, should alert other Europeans of the need to stick together. âMany people today are asking the same question,â he said. âWhat do we do if confronted by the same choiceâ British voters faced.
The question of when Britain will invoke Article 50, opening negotiations, has dominated discussion in London and some other capitals, but has left some leaders cold.
âI think itâs utterly disappointing that, when we are faced with the biggest political crisis in the history of the European Union, whatâs grabbing the headlines is the obscure Article 50,â Joseph Muscat, the prime minister of Malta, said in Brussels. The far more important issue, he said, is âthat this is a Europe that people are feeling increasingly estranged from and that it is our duty that we take action.â

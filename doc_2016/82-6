One could not help but feel that Helena Newman, the Sothebyâs auctioneer on Monday night, was almost begging for a bid of more than $50 million for Edvard Munchâs 1902 painting âGirls on the Bridge.â
Still, the room was quiet. Despite what felt like an excruciatingly long wait â during which Ms. Newman even delayed by sipping water â the painting attracted only a single bid.
That was from a buyer who had agreed before the auction to guarantee the sale.
âI was surprised by that,â Morgan Long, senior director at the Fine Art Group in London, said. âIt was a good picture.â
So it went at Sothebyâs Impressionist and Modern auction, the first in a packed week of sales that may test the strength of the art market. The big question was, would the presidential election have an effect â or for that matter, would Brexit, the referendum by Britain to abandon the 
The sale total was considerably smaller than Sothebyâs 
Conventional wisdom says that sellers are taking a wait-and-see approach in light of tumultuous world events.
âThe sales are thinner,â said James Roundell, the director of Impressionist and Modern art at Dickinson, an art advisory based in London and New York. âPeople have wondered, âDo I sell now, or wait?â There was an argument for waiting.â
Still, Ms. Newman said after the auction that the final price of $54.5 million with fees was âstill the second-highest price for a Munch ever achieved at auction.â She also said âit was a lively room,â though none of the eveningâs three big-ticket works with third-party guarantees appeared to attract an external bid.

Many collectors and dealers deemed the sale solid; the low bids, they said, were more about the quality of works for sale, rather than the state of the world.
âNot a single one of my clients has held back because of the election,â Mary Hoeveler, a New York art adviser, said. âBut there is a supply issue. Weâve seen this over the last couple of years. So much of this auction was day-sale quality,â she said, referring to day salesâ less desirable offerings.
One of the few lots that generated competition was an early minimalist 1923 painting by the Bauhaus artist LÃ¡szlÃ³ Moholy-Nagy, which went for an auction high of $6.1 million on an estimate of $3 million to $4 million. The buyer: Mathias Rastorfer of the Galerie Gmurzynska, who had sold the work to the seller in 1987.
âIt was a very good buy, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have a work of that importance,â Mr. Rastorfer said after the sale.
The Munch, the most high-valued auction lot of the week, was consigned by a collector who had bought the painting for $30.8 million at Sothebyâs in 2008. The composition, showing a gaggle of young girls chatting beside the sinister reflection of a tree, is one of the Norwegian artistâs most celebrated Symbolist subjects. It is one of the earliest of Munchâs 12 known paintings of the subject and is one of just two left in private hands.
Sothebyâs also had third-party guarantees for Pablo Picassoâs 1963 painting âLe Peintre et Son ModÃ¨le,â estimated at $12 million to $18 million, and Vincent van Goghâs 1886 flower still life, âNature Morte: Vase aux GlaÃ¯euls,â at $5 million to $7 million. The typical late-period Picasso, formerly owned by the New York collector Joan Oestreich Kend, who died in April, sold for $12.9 million to the guarantor. Van Goghâs darker study of gladioli, painted in Paris before his move to Provence, raised $5.9 million.
Guarantees are shoring up Sothebyâs sales; its contemporary art auction on Wednesday will feature more than 30 such minimum prices. Sothebyâs last week 
The opacity of Sothebyâs third-party arrangements has been criticized by the art trade for hiding the true sales prices.
Some of this may become a little clearer. New York Cityâs Consumer Affairs Department recommended in September that the auction houses publish net prices for works that have been backed by external finance. For example, the $54.5 million for the Munch was a net price that reflected a âfixed feeâ of about $2 million paid by Sothebyâs to the third-party guarantor.

Re Marine Le Pen’s “After Brexit, the People’s Spring is Inevitable” (Op-ed, June 28):
Regarding the European Union, Le Pen asserts that “It’s democratic in appearance only, because it’s based on a lie: the pretense that there is a homogeneous European people.”
True, in the sense that there is no such thing as “a homogeneous people,” so no political entity can possibly act according to the will of all of the individuals it governs. The U.S. government sometimes enacts laws that the majority of Californians oppose. Or in terms that Ms. Le Pen will understand: Normans and Corsicans don’t always agree on what rules are best.
And yet we choose to have governments, because the alternative is “every man for himself.”
The European Union came about, in no small part, to stop the ancient cycle of war that had beset Europe for millenniums. Yes, it required the individual states to surrender some of their sovereignty, but that was a sacrifice people were willing to make. Let us hope that as we look towards the future, we don’t lose sight of the past.

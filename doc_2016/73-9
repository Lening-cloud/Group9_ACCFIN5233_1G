But he was not the only winner. His wife, Kim Sears, seated in the family box, was herself something of an attention magnet for the duration of the tournament.
A fixture on the sidelines of her husbandâs matches for almost a decade (they married in 2015), Ms. Sears has won more admiring glances this year than any other for her strategic choices in courtside attire.

Over the course of Wimbledon, she wore dresses from names like Burberry Brit, Whistles, Beulah London and Ted Baker, and chose a marigold yellow embroidered number â with a price of Â£2,200 ($2,848) â by Jenny Packham for the championship match on Sunday, later choosing a 
The consistent thread? Ms. Searsâs decision to almost exclusively support homegrown British brands and designers, following in the (nude L. K.

The recognition of the power she has during grand slam events for those two weeks in the limelight each time can only be a good thing.
Not that Ms. Sears hasnât been aware of her sartorial powers in the past. After being caught swearing in January 2015 while watching Mr. Murray play Tomas Berdych in the Australian Open, she responded by

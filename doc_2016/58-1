It is true that the European referendum in Britain didnât go the way many businesses in the City of London expected, or hoped. But London is Europeâs leading center for financial services for many reasons, and I do not believe that this status is at risk.
London is the leading European hub for professional and financial services primarily because of the talent of the people here, the rule of law and the quality of the judicial process, and exceptional infrastructure. None of these attributes have been affected by the vote to leave the European Union.
London will continue to thrive. London has, in a sense, always been in flux, constantly reinventing itself to reflect changing needs and economic demands. There is no reason London will not still maintain its position as a world leader in industries like financial technology, foreign exchange and professional services.
The future may look different, but it will still be successful thanks to Londonâs ability to adapt and embrace change, as we have done for centuries.

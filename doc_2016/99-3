Grim tidings are spread with great cheer in âPrivacy,â James Graham and Josie Rourkeâs perky investigation into the consequences of living your life online. This 
The presence of the man who played Harry Potter isnât the only reason âPrivacyâ has become one of New Yorkâs hottest tickets. Viewed as a play, it is neither as profound as it aspires to be nor even entirely cohesive. But it ingeniously recreates that most venerable of entertainments, the magic show, in a form ideally suited to the second decade of the 21st century.
Like the work of celebrated prestidigitators (like David Copperfield, 
But âPrivacyâ goes one painful, enlightening step further by always putting the âow!â in âwow!â Thatâs because the secret-wranglers onstage â embodied by a vivacious supporting cast â are not relying principally on human intuition or hidden accomplices or bait-and-switch techniques. No, they can look deep into what passes for your soul these days because they have access to your smartphones.

In other words, Big Brother and company have replaced the dashing figures who pull rabbits out of hats. Though the play quotes the phrase âbe not afeardâ from Shakespeareâs âThe Tempest,â the purpose of âPrivacyâ is to scare you silly, through only seemingly silly means. By the way, one of the folks who recites those words happens to be Edward J. Snowden â the exiled, whistle-blowing computer whiz and former National Security Agency contractor â whose appearance here is made possible by the double-edged technology that gives âPrivacyâ its style and substance.
I think itâs O.K. to mention Mr. Snowden. (His videotaped appearance in âPrivacyâ 
But to avoid being stigmatized as a spoiler, I will honor Mr. Radcliffeâs plea. Which doesnât leave me with a whole lot to talk about, except in abstract terms, and the coolest tricks in âPrivacyâ involve very detailed specifics.
Like personal specifics. Like 
Iâm making âPrivacyâ sound creepier and more compelling than it ultimately is. As written by Mr. Graham (the author of the terrific British Parliament docudrama âThis Houseâ) and Ms. Rourke (the artistic director of 
The lost soul portrayed by Mr. Radcliffe, known simply as the Writer, is treated less gently. When the play begins, he has just ended a relationship with someone to whom he refers with the gender-neutral pronoun of âthey.â Even speaking to his new psychiatrist, Josh Cohen (Reg Rogers), the Writer is coy about âtheyâ â who appears to have walked out precisely because the Writer is so withholding of his innermost self.
Being English, he says, he is an instinctively private person, with âa phobia of being known.â In an effort to break down those self-isolating walls, he crosses the Atlantic to New York City, where his ex now resides. (It turns out to be a he, for the record.) Little does the Writer know, at this point, how completely known he is already, simply because he uses his smartphone and laptop.
On hand to edify him are a host of fantasy versions of real people who embody different sides of the argument on public versus private selves. Such academic cultural commentators as 
Retailing entrepreneurs and Silicon Valley executives; representatives of government surveillance agencies; politicians and journalists (among them, Ewen MacAskill, a reporter for the London publication The Guardian who helped break the Snowden story) â they also appear to explain how completely we expose ourselves every time we log on. They are brought to chipper, slightly cartoonish life by a cast appealingly rounded out by DeâAdre Aziza, Raffi Barsoumian and Michael Countryman.
The technical team â which includes Lucy Osborne (sets), Richard Howell (lighting) and Duncan McLean (projections) â adroitly conjures a world in which what we see on tiny screens seems to grow into three dimensions, even as so-called real life flattens out. The parts of the show I canât talk about â the many audience participation sequences â are both its giddiest and most sobering.
âPrivacyâ doesnât provide much material that hasnât been rehashed many times in newspaper and magazine (and blog and vlog) essays. It can feel rather like one of those middle school instructional films that use a likable animated creature (a talking dinosaur or skeleton, maybe) to keep its distractible young viewers hooked.
The scene in which I felt most engaged, confused and affected involves little techno sleight of hand, just a very deft performer (that would be Mr. Radcliffe) treading water in an improvisational sequence.
Or was it? I can say no more. But itâs a relief to be able to report that âPrivacyâ shines brightest when it comes down to a single actor plying centuries-old tricks of his trade.

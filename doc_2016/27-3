A traditionally reliable indicator, lurking in a recent opinion poll, suggests Britain will vote on Thursday to remain in the European Union.
The main question that polling firms typically ask respondents in any contest is how they intend to vote. In the case of the referendum on âBrexit,â as a possible British exit from the E.U. is known, the polls straightforwardly ask people if they want to remain in the union or leave. After a string of polls showing a sizable lead for âleave,â polls released in the last few days effectively show a tie, or a small lead for remaining. This shift away from âleaveâ prompted a rally in global markets on Monday.
But one of those polls, 
When Survation asked, âRegardless of how you plan to vote, what do you think the result will be?â just shy of 40 percent of people said the âremainâ camp would win. Only 26 percent said that âleaveâ would prevail.
The remaining 34 percent said they did not know what the result would be. Mr. Rothschild said the âdonât knowâ figure is high for this sort of question. But he noted that undecided voters tend to support the status quo, in part because they are more risk-averse and may be less informed.
Also notable: Supporters of the leave camp donât seem to have a high level of confidence that their side will prevail. Some 35 percent of âleaveâ supporters said they thought âremainâ would win. By contrast, only 14 percent of âremainâ supporters predicted that âleaveâ would win.
Of course, this is not a guaranteed indicator; the Brexit referendum may be a vote that reveals its limitations.
All things considered, though, âremainâ seems to be in a strong position in these last days before the vote. The surge in the polls for âleaveâ appears to have been stalled, or even reversed. The

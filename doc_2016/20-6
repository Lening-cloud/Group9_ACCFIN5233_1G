(SOUNDBITE) (German) GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL, SAYING:
âThe European Union is strong enough in order to absorb the exit of Great Britain. It is strong enough to proceed with only 27 members. And it is strong enough to represent its interests in the world.

The European Union is one of the biggest economic zones in the world. It is a unique community of shared solidarity and values, with great appeal in the whole world. And it guarantees peace, wealth and stability.â

 (SOUNDBITE) (German) GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL, SAYING:
âWe will make sure that the negotiations will not follow the principle of cherry-picking. There has to be and there will be a clear distinction whether a country wants to be a part of the EU family or not. [APPLAUSE] Whoever decides to leave that family cannot expect all obligations to be omitted while keeping its privileges.â

(SOUNDBITE) (German) GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL, SAYING:
âAfter their application (to leave the EU), then the 27 other countries will determine the principles for the negotiations as mentioned in article 50 paragraph 2 of the European treaties. Only after setting those principles, the negotiations can start. Not before, neither formal nor informal. [APPLAUSE] We take note of that Great Britain does not yet want to make an application according to article 50 of the EU treaties. And Great Britain in turn has to take note, that there will be no negotiations or preliminary talks whatsoever as long as there has not been made an application according to article 50. Neither formal nor informal.â
In the European Parliament, one of the leading Brexit advocates, Nigel Farage, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party, chastised his Continental colleagues for never having âdone a proper job in your lives.â
Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, confronted Mr. Farage, a longtime member of the European Parliament despite his antipathy for the bloc.

âThat is the last time that you are applauding here. And to some extent, Iâm really surprised that you are here. You are fighting for the exit, the British people voted in favour of the exit , why are you here?â

(SOUNDBITE) (English) LEADER OF THE EUROPEAN PEOPLEâS PARTY, MANFRED WEBER, SAYING:
âWe say, our message today is: the young generation of the United Kingdom can continue to trust in their friends in Europe, we donât leave you on your own.â

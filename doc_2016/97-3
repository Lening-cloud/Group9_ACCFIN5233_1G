The first part of the exhibition is a mural on the wall. The mural has Leonardo da Vinci’s “Vitruvian Man” on the floor. This is an immersive experience, so you’re meant to walk it. Now, this is an image that shows man being the measure of all things, and it also represents the arts and sciences. What I’ve done there is to transform that image, so rather than that image just being the image of a man, it’s a man and a woman, and the face looks more like an African face than a European face. But really the point there, the theme that will go throughout the exhibition, is the universality of culture.
Basically, it’s about universal humanism. It’s a very inclusive exhibition. It includes other unrepresented cultures within the Western canons. And it’s the first time I’m actually going to be presenting hand-drawn screen prints. I juxtapose Western religious iconography with African religious iconography.
Art is also not just about polemics. Art is really about engaging with a particular experience that may in fact create all kinds of emotion for people. They can be uplifted by it, they might discover new things, or they may just simply be appalled or actually enjoy the work. It’s all subjective. But imagining human life without culture must be terrible. I can’t imagine human existence without music, without art, without dance, without all these things that make us feel human.

The feeling that “We want our country back” is analogous to the Trumpian case to “Make America great again.” However, a further dimension has parallels with the culture wars waged by mainstream Republicans in the United States. As Ms. Lyall points out, few people in Britain are aware of what the European Union actually does, and few care very much about it. They have been mobilized against the European Union by decades of misleading propaganda from the right-leaning media in Britain much as many Americans have been led to believe that laws on same-sex marriage or toilet arrangements are central to their lives.
This double motivation of nationalism and culture wars has brought Britain to the edge of a momentous, and potentially disastrous, decision on June 23.

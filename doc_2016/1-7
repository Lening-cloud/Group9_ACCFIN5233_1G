LONDON â Against a backdrop of rising political acrimony, Theresa May, the British prime minister, warned critics on Sunday not to thwart her timetable for withdrawal from the European Union, as she prepared for a standoff with lawmakers that could prompt calls for an early general election here.
Mrs. May, who wants to start the formal process of leaving the bloc by the end of March, now has a serious fight on her hands, after several months of facing relatively little challenge over her plans for British withdrawal, known as âBrexit.â

The government is appealing the case to the Supreme Court, but if it loses, and then finds itself constrained by lawmakers, the temptation to seek an early general election may become overwhelming for Mrs. May.
For now, the government is playing down that prospect. Mrs. May insisted on Sunday that she had a mandate to pursue Britainâs exit without consulting Parliament. In a referendum in June, about 52 percent of voters elected to quit the bloc.
âThe British people, the majority of the British people, voted to leave the European Union,â Mrs. May said at Heathrow Airport as she left for a trade mission to India. âThe government is now getting on with that.â
After the court ruling, however, Mrs. May now knows there is a good chance that she may not be able to do so with the free hand that she wants. So far she has specified almost no detail about her objectives, arguing that she wants to keep her negotiating position as strong as possible.
At the heart of the dispute lies an ambiguity inherent in a referendum that asked voters to say whether they wanted to quit the European Union but that did not seek their views on what relationship should replace it.
Supporters of Brexit contend that opponents now want to thwart the will of the people as expressed in the referendum. Critics fear that the government has no coherent Brexit strategy, and worry that the country may lurch into a damaging economic rupture with the bloc, which voters did not endorse.

Nigel Farage, the interim leader of the U.K. Independence Party, which campaigned for British withdrawal, warned of protests in the streets if the decision in favor of Brexit was ignored.
âBelieve you me, if the people in this country think theyâre going to be cheated, theyâre going to be betrayed, then we will see political anger the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed in this country,â he said.
The court ruling has unleashed an ugly political discourse, with one tabloid newspaper that supported Brexit describing the judges who delivered the verdict as â
Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how âBrexitâ has affected business so far.
While the government has said it defends the independence of the judiciary, it has not rushed to condemn the newspaper coverage, prompting criticism from some senior legal figures.
More worrisome for Mrs. May is the parliamentary math should she be forced to take her case for British withdrawal to lawmakers.
Last week, David Davis, the secretary of state for exiting the European Union, conceded that if the appeal to the Supreme Court failed, the government would probably have to put forward legislation to trigger Article 50. That could give opponents the possibility to amend it, and tie down its negotiating stance.

The partyâs deputy leader, Tom Watson, took a more lenient position. He 
Asked about the possibility of a general election, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told the BBC on Sunday that it was âthe last thing the government wantsâ â a formulation that does not specifically exclude it happening.

If the courtâs ruling is upheld â the government immediately vowed to appeal â that plan would be thrown into disarray, analysts said.
Mrs. May would be forced to work with Parliament and consider its competing priorities for Britainâs future. Specifically, she would have to give it a detailed strategy for negotiating the British departure, or â
Few observers say they believe that Parliament will go so far as to prevent a departure from the bloc. Lawmakers themselves voted overwhelmingly to hold the referendum and pledged to abide by the results.
The more likely impact could be to weaken Mrs. Mayâs hold on the negotiating process. Her main priority has been controlling immigration and Britainâs borders, even if that hurts the economy by forcing her nation to leave the European Unionâs

But it was not immediately clear how the politics would play out. The Conservative government is already split over what kind of future relationship it wants with the European Union, and in general, members of Parliament were not in favor of leaving the bloc in the first place. The government hoped to get the talks started without a major parliamentary debate and potential interference, especially in the House of Lords, where the Conservatives do not have a clear majority.
If Mrs. May should find parliamentary opposition intolerable, she might ultimately be tempted to seek an early general election to gain a wider mandate for leaving the bloc, some analysts said. Currently, her Conservative Party holds a slim majority, with 
The ruling unsettled the proponents of exiting the European Union, who warned against backsliding. 
âI see M.P.s from all parties saying, âOh well, actually we should stay part of the single market; we should continue with our daily financial contributions,â â he said in an interview on BBC Radio. âI think we could be at the beginning, with this ruling, of a process where there is a deliberate, willful attempt by our political class to betray 17.4 million voters.â
On Thursday, the government said that an expedited appeal would be heard in December by the Supreme Court, Britainâs highest appellate body, and that it was sticking to its timetable for leaving the bloc for now. Yet in the growing environment of constitutional, legal and political uncertainty, the governmentâs strategy could easily be disrupted.
The ruling was âa severe setback for Theresa Mayâs government,â said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a political consulting firm. But he added that the governmentâs timetable could still be met if the Supreme Court ruled in its favor.
The British government must consult Parliament before proceeding with formal negotiations over its withdrawal from the European Union, the High Court ruled. The legal action was brought in the name of several individuals.
Although Parliament approved holding the referendum, Mrs. Mayâs critics argued in court that failing to give lawmakers a voice would turn them into bystanders as Britain negotiated its disengagement from the bloc. They also pointed out that, technically, the referendum is not legally binding.
The case, brought by several plaintiffs, including 
The plaintiffs argued successfully that leaving the European Union involved the revocation of certain rights granted to Britons by Parliament, and that lawmakers must have a say and a vote before Article 50 is invoked.
In his ruling, the lord chief justice, John Thomas, said, âThe most fundamental rule of the U.K. Constitution is that Parliament is sovereign and can make or unmake any law it chooses.â
Oddly enough, this was precisely the case made by those who wanted to end membership, who argued that only by leaving the European Union could Parliamentâs sovereignty be completely restored. Now that same argument could delay the very exit so desired by those politicians and their supporters.
Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how âBrexitâ has affected business so far.
The government argued that under residual powers of royal prerogative, which cover international treaty-making, it had the power to invoke Article 50 without a vote in Parliament.
But the court found that invoking Article 50 would essentially repeal the 
Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, welcomed the ruling, adding that it was âdisappointing that this government was so intent on undermining parliamentary sovereignty and democratic process that they forced this decision to be made in the court.â
In a statement, he added, âGiven the strict two-year timetable of exiting the E.U. once Article 50 is triggered, it is critical that the government now lay out their negotiating to Parliament, before such a vote is held.â

Although Mrs. May has said that lawmakers will eventually be consulted, many fear it will take place too late to influence the shape of Britainâs new relationship with the European Union.
For example, if Parliament is given a chance to vote on an exit agreement at the end of the two-year period, lawmakers may be forced to choose between endorsing a deal they oppose or leaving the bloc without any formal relationship with it.
The government had dismissed the case as legal âcamouflage,â regarding it as a thinly disguised effort to frustrate the democratic outcome of the June 23 referendum.
The Conservative Party, which was badly split over the referendum, has now largely embraced its outcome, in many cases enthusiastically.
Many supporters of the opposition Labour Party also voted to leave the European Union, which will make it harder for their lawmakers to oppose a withdrawal.
Along with the Supreme Court, the ruling might ultimately be referred to the European Court of Justice, an institution opposed by many who argued for Britain to leave the bloc.

In the âAfterthoughtsâ to his book about the decline of public language in politics, Mark Thompson mentions something that for me clarified the 12 chapters that went before. Thompson, who grew up in England and was director-general of the BBC before taking his current job as chief executive of The New York Times Company, was invited in 2012 to give a series of lectures on the âart of public persuasionâ at Oxford, his alma mater. From those lectures and subsequent discussions, he writes, âEnough Saidâ arose.
Knowing the bookâs genesis is useful in understanding the kind of value it has, and what it does not do. To oversimplify, the most influential nonfiction books usually exist either to tell a story, as with âSeabiscuitâ and âAll the Presidentâs Men,â or to advance an argument, as with âSilent Springâ and âThe Feminine Mystique.â Ideally they combine the two, as for example Michael Lewis did with his tale of the origins of the 2008 financial crisis, âThe Big Short.â
Lecture series, and books derived from them, are different in that their assumed interest comes from watching a thinker engage with a set topic and seeing what insights emerge, rather than expecting a clear narrative or argument to ring through. Thatâs the case with âEnough Said.â Given Thompsonâs standing as a past leader of one of the worldâs dominant news organizations and the current head of another, what he thinks about the interactions among politicians, citizens and the press is by definition important. I donât think this book will change the continuing debates about âbiasâ and âobjectivity,â the separation of the public into distinct fact universes, the disappearing boundary between entertainment and civic life, the imperiled concept of âtruthâ or the other important topics it addresses. But it offers many instructive allusions, useful judgments and important refinements on these themes â and provides reassurance by its mere existence that someone in the authorâs position is grappling so earnestly with such questions.
For me the book is strongest by far when it is most like a story â Thompsonâs own story, of his 30-plus years with the BBC. They began in his early 20s, when he was a research assistant trainee, continued with his rise to producer, editor and top executive, and coincided with dramatic changes in both politics and the language of public affairs in Britain. Thompson describes these vividly and well. He emphasizes the shift in political rhetoric from Margaret Thatcherâs forcefulness â âhard-edged, insistent, utterly sure of itselfâ â to the smoothly sophisticated message discipline and media management of Tony Blair in his early years. He also describes the ways, successful and otherwise, that he and others in the British press tried to keep up. Crucially, he knows the nuances of these people and predicaments so well that he need not stop with saying that certain choices were difficult or complex. He can go on to argue why, despite the complexity, decisions he made were right (for instance, to introduce a new kind of news coverage in the Thatcher era) or why distortions by some politicians (notably Blairâs, in urging Britain into war in Iraq) were worse than others.
Although Thompson worked in the United States for a time as a BBC producer in the 1980s and returned once he joined The Times four years ago, his feel for American politics is naturally not a match for what he knows about Britain. When providing American examples for his analysis, he often stops at the âdifficult and complexâ stage. One example: In a survey of books about the dysfunction of the United States federal government, he mentions âItâs Even Worse Than It Looks,â a prescient 2012 book by Norman J. Ornstein and Thomas E. Mann about problems within the Republican Party. But he dismisses it by saying that âtheir thrust is resolutely one-sidedâ and that âblaming an adverse trend in political culture entirely on one party .â.â. is scarcely a recipe for reducing political division.â This sounds balanced, but it doesnât acknowledge the influential and carefully argued point of Ornstein and Mannâs book, which was precisely that the extremist forces in modern politics had been much more damaging on the Republican than on the Democratic side.
Another example: Thompson contrasts the âtwo rhetoricsâ of public life, what Mario Cuomo called the poetry of campaigning and the prose of governance, and says that Barack Obama is âperhaps the most obvious example .â.â. âthe change we needâ giving way almost overnight to tight-lipped and sometimes testy managerialism.â In Thompsonâs view, âthe word-worlds of Obama the campaigner and Obama the president turned out to be so different that it was almost as if they were twin brothers with contrasting personalities.â In fact, compared with that of other presidents, Obamaâs rhetoric is remarkable for how little it has changed over the years. As a matter of achievement, the President Obama who has not closed GuantÃ¡namo or cleaned up Wall Street is a disappointment to some of his supporters. But the rhetorician Obama who spoke to the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia this summer could have taken whole paragraphs from the speech with which the young Illinois State Senator Barack Obama made his national debut at the Democratic Convention in Boston 12 years ago. Both spoke of Americaâs constantly becoming a better version of itself. Both emphasized what united rather than divided their fellow citizens.
Beyond British and American politics, Thompson covers a wide range of additional subjects. He discusses the classic Greek elements of rhetoric, including logos (argument), ethos (the character of the speaker) and pathos (emotion), along with other Greek rhetorical concepts. He talks about the punchy, Trump-like language of Vladimir Putin and the theatrics of Silvio Berlusconi. A whole chapter is built around George Orwellâs famous essay âPolitics and the English Language.â He punctuates his discussions with sweeping summaries like this one, in reference to social media: âThe art of persuasion, once the grandest of the humanities and accessible at its highest level only to those of genius â a Demosthenes or a Cicero, a Lincoln or a Churchill â is acquiring many of the attributes of a computational science. Rhetoric not as art but as algorithm.â
Thompson examines the rhetorical extremes through which the British public considered its Brexit vote and the American public considers the prospect of a President Trump, and the ways residents of both countries evaluate rhetoric about climate change. He gives few details about the strategy he is applying in his current job, at The Times, to keep the newspaper economically viable and credible to its readers, but he closes a passage on the digital transformation of news with a lament that âtraditionalâ journalists may have become âa tribe whose discourse no longer has the breadth or the adaptability to reflect reality, but whose befuddlement is such that, even if they are aware of the dilemma, they are more likely to blame reality than themselves. .â.â. The important question about much old-fashioned journalism is not whether it 
Thompsonâs employees, and those at other traditional news outlets, will be relieved to hear that his answer is yes: Journalism matters and journalists deserve to survive. He closes the book with some unexceptional but important advice for all affected parties: Politicians should not say one thing and do another; journalists shouldnât lie and should be fair; members of the public should be more willing to pay attention and absorb real facts. The destination is not surprising, but there is enlightenment along the way.

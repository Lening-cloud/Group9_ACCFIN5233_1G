LONDON â Her beloved father, an Anglican vicar, died in a car crash when she was 25, after she had been married only a year, and her mother, who had multiple sclerosis, died a few months later. For 
It brought her even closer to her husband, Philip, two years younger, whom she had met at Oxford, at a Conservative Party disco. They bonded over cricket and silly university debates, like the one where Philip induced her to speak for the motion âthat sex is good â¦ but success is better.â
Both became bankers, and Ms. May threw herself into the Conservative politics that had entranced her since the age of 12, when she liked to argue with her father and he asked her, in order to maintain neutrality in his parish, not to parade her Tory colors in public.
âPolitics captured me,â 
On Wednesday, 
For Ms. May, only Britainâs second female prime minister, it is a job she never publicly acknowledged wanting, until Mr. Cameron, bluff and self-confident, pushed his luck once too often, 
Ms. May, who had been home secretary, is considered âa safe pair of hands,â not flashy and even dull, who seems to be a candidate of continuity. But the countryâs dire circumstances may demand more. And Ms. May, a traditional economic and social conservative in many respects, has signaled a desire to give her party a new focus on the need to build a fairer society.

Her six-year tenure at the Home Office showed her to be a tough operator and put her in charge of a number of flash-point issues. She demanded police reforms to reduce racial profiling. She helped push through surveillance policies that had to balance fears of terrorism against civil liberties and confronted public pressure to reduce immigration, failing to meet government targets for doing so. If sometimes at odds with Mr. Cameronâs inner circle â she was a quiet critic of the governmentâs budget austerity â she nonetheless built a reputation as smart and competent.
Damian Green, who worked for her as Home Office minister until 2014, said that âTheresa doesnât do verbiage, doesnât do speeches for the sake of making speeches. One of her virtues is that when she says something today she means it tomorrow.â
But she will have to bind a badly torn party in which she has won esteem but few close friends. She will also have to juggle competing priorities in negotiating the withdrawal from the European Union under the watchful eye of Brexit supporters who remain wary of her commitment to their cause.
Even though she publicly if tepidly supported remaining in Europe out of loyalty to Mr. Cameron, saying it would be best for the nationâs security, at heart âshe is a Euroskeptic,â said Catherine Meyer, a former treasurer of the Conservative Party and a friend of the Maysâ. âWhen she says Brexit means out, she means it.â
While respected within the European Union as a tough and unpretentious negotiator, Ms. May will have to find the right balance between more controls on immigration that the voters demanded and at least partial access, if she can manage it, to the single market of the European Union.
Friends say that her early religious upbringing â she is an Anglican but went to a Roman Catholic school â has given Ms. May a moral base, a steady personality and a feeling for the disadvantaged. âHer background has shaped her into somebody who is not going to feel sorry for herself or blame others for her mistakes, and who finds solace in moving forward, not to sit but to fight,â said Ms. Meyer, who worked with Ms. May on a charity for abducted children.
A young woman who hunched her shoulders at school to seem less tall has grown into a proud master of her responsibilities. She lives for her work and her husband, a well-off investment banker, and their time together in their neat house in Sonning-on-Thames, in Berkshire, in the heart of her Maidenhead constituency, a village she shares with better-known types like the guitarist Jimmy Page and George and Amal Clooney. She likes to cook and owns more than 100 cookbooks, and will likely be glad that the Camerons took the heat for remodeling the ancient kitchen at 10 Downing Street.
Mr. Cameron valued her workaholic talents, naming her Home Office secretary, one of the four senior cabinet posts, only the second woman to hold the job. Wary of her quiet ambition and wanting to protect his own favorite, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, he never promoted her further. But he did not demote her, either, even as she failed to deliver on one of the governmentâs key pledges, to curb immigration. She was famous for fighting her corner, knowing her subject and keeping clear of the Cameron âchumocracy.â
Ms. May is polite but not chummy, works late and does not hang around Parliamentâs bars. Her lack of a âset of friendsâ was considered one of her great liabilities in the race to succeed Mr. Cameron, said Crispin Blunt, a Conservative member of Parliament who is one of her supporters. âThere wasnât an army of mates for her,â he said, but it allows her now to make appointments to her government on the basis of her own priorities and assessments.
âIn government, sometimes itâs difficult to be a woman surrounded by lots of men,â said Ms. Meyer. âLike Margaret Thatcher, she likes the company of men, but sheâs capable of putting her fist down.â
Ms. May was co-founder in 2005 of a group called â
In office, Ms. May has been rigorous, largely sticking to her brief, which she knew in depth, and not often consulting cabinet colleagues. One former minister, Kenneth Clarke, called her âa bloody difficult woman,â a description she embraced. She tends to work alone or with a small number of aides, like Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, and has a tendency to micromanage, a senior civil servant said, asking anonymity.
After two failed attempts, she was elected to Parliament in 1997. In 2002, when chosen to chair the party, Ms. May 
In 2014, she again earned attention for taking on the powerful police union, the Police Federation, limiting âstop and searchâ because of racial bias and imposing elected oversight commissions on the police. To a stunned conference of police, she 
Among her most controversial acts was helping to push through a so-called âsnooperâs charter,â giving the police and security services new powers in a world of digital communications and terrorism. After criticism that the measure impinged too much on civil liberties and individual rights, she agreed to some changes.
Ms. May has been compared to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany â both daughters of Protestant clergymen, both with quiet, private husbands, both without children, both hardworking and rather distant. Ms. May clearly sees the similarities, including being underestimated by men.
âIf you look at somebody like Angela Merkel and think of what sheâs actually achieved, you know, there are still people who donât rate her, are a bit dismissive, perhaps because of the way she looks and dresses,â Ms. May said in a 2012 interview with the Daily Telegraph. âWhat matters is, what has she actually done? And, when you look at her abilities in terms of negotiation, and steering Germany through a difficult time, then hats off to her.â
She has only rarely spoken publicly about her personal life, though it briefly became a campaign issue when one of her challengers, 
âYou look at families all the time and you see there is something there that you donât have,â Ms. May 
She has made a calculated effort to show some inner life and spark by her choice of clothes, especially her kitten-heeled animal-print shoes, which the British press 
When asked on Desert Island Discs what single novel she wanted as a castaway, she answered, âPride and Prejudice.â And her single luxury? âA lifetime subscription to Vogue.â

Some took issue with being identified as far-right supporters, saying they were simply challenging a mainstream that did not reflect their beliefs or experiences. And many of the readers, who were predominantly male, would not give their names, saying they feared stigmatization.
These responses have been edited for length and clarity. And because many of the issues raised are highly contentious across Europe, we have provided context with each submission.
Symbolic politics of âhelpingâ those who need help by inviting them in regardless of circumstances and economy donât help. Our economy doesnât increase along with the never-ending supply of immigrants. To help, you figure out the cause of the problem and fix it. Itâs like buying buckets for a leaky roof instead of just fixing the roof itself.

Three things make me consider voting for the Sweden Democrats, even if I find the partyâs historical links to white supremacy repugnant and donât agree with their anti-E.U. and anti-NATO membership stances: mass immigration and open borders, identity politics, and âestablishmentâ propaganda for the previous two.
Sweden has had massive immigration over the past couple of decades. Instead of acknowledging the problems related to mass immigration, the mainstream parties and mainstream media have for decades either ignored them, blamed them on Swedish/Swedesâ racism, blamed them on lack of social services or claimed that while there may be initial cost with immigration, itâs profitable long term.
Why would a male, ethnic Swedish worker want to vote for political parties which see âwhite menâ as oppressors and regularly denigrate their ethnicity and culture?

â¢ Swedenâs reputation as one of the most welcoming nations in Europe has been challenged. 
As a young adult, I would like to vote for something fresh with no or few connections to the previous regime. Only the far-right party is speaking about real problems, e.g., the two largest parties promise to solve Gypsy-related issues (their low education, their low income), but they never do anything.

I like Europe and have plenty of friends from other countries in Europe, but this does not alter the fact that I do not feel a sense of belonging to Europe, especially not the âEuropeâ sold to us by the E.U. project. I feel that Franceâs destiny lies with Africa and our close European neighbors, which is something that the National Front embraces: a truly independent France working for its own destiny. I may not embrace all of the partyâs solutions and proposals, but everything starts and ends with sovereignty.

Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.
Watching 800,000 uninvited illegal migrants wander into the country, and seeing Germany allow these people to ignore the law and do what they wanted, I realized that countries that canât control their borders â or wonât because of misguided naÃ¯ve ideas about âhuman rightsâ â are doomed unless the people who pay the taxes and make things work have some say in the matter. It is a new âsilent majorityâ that has been cowed into submission by a liberal press and cowardly politicians. Time to end this.

Iâve voted for the F.P.Ã. for many reasons related to foreigners, but in most cases, the foreigners are not guilty. Our government is responsible for the hate against foreigners, because many Austrians feel like second-class citizens in their own country.
In Austria, itâs mandatory for young men to serve in the army. If your military service is not over, itâs nearly impossible to get a job. So when I dropped out because of problems with high blood pressure, I had to apply for social care. Because I had never worked before, I only got the absolute minimum of 313 euros a month. Refugees got more than â¬700 a month at the same time.

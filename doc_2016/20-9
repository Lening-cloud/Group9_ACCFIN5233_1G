Anyone trying to explain Britainâs decision to exit the European Union must consider the countryâs economy, its citizensâ attitudes toward immigration, its generational divides and the 
But there is another force to consider, too: the role of the worldâs most influential social media platforms â Facebook, in particular. More than 33 million people in Britain use Facebook each month, according to estimates by eMarketer, a research company.
A few data points about the vast online conversation before the vote suggest that the people supporting the âleaveâ campaign were far more engaged on the issue than their opponents on social media.
Using data pulled from CrowdTangle, a social media analytics firm that has a partnership with Facebook, The New York Times ranked Facebook pages that had the most engagement â how many people liked, shared and commented on posts â around the term âEuropean Unionâ over the last 30 days.
Seven of the top 20 pages with the most engagement around âEuropean Union,â including the top two, were explicitly pro-exit. Together, these seven pages produced more than 1.3 million interactions â including the page for Nigel Farage, a leading proponent of the âleaveâ campaign, at No. 6.
Only two pages â those of the group Britain Stronger in Europe, No. 8, and the British Prime Minister David Cameron, No. 18 â were clearly associated with âremainâ campaigns, and together, they accounted for just under 150,000 interactions.
A search for âBrexit,â the widely used shorthand for the vote, produced a similar ranking. Other top pages included British and American news organizations that had broad news coverage, as well as pro-leave and pro-remain opinion columns.
An analysis of two opposing campaign pages underscores the wide gap in reader activity. By Friday, a primary page for the âremainâ campaign, Britain Stronger in Europe, had passed 558,000 followers. Its close counterpart â Leave. EU â led in followers, at just over 767,000. But the pagesâ total engagement figures, which approximate total conversations around all their posts, were far more disparate.
Over the last six months, posts on âremainâ pages resulted in more than 3.3 million interactions â that is likes, shares and comments â averaging about 475,000 a month. The âleaveâ page produced more than 11 million, or about three times as many.
Between these groups, the official âleaveâ message, in other words, landed harder and most likely spread further on Facebook by a large margin.
This month, Vyacheslav Polonski, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, published a study of Brexit campaignsâ activity on Instagram. Mr. Polonski analyzed the activities of over 15,000 users who engaged in the referendum debate.
âWeâve noted that E.U. skeptics and Brexit supporters dominate the debate and are more effective in their use of Instagram for activating and mobilizing people across the country,â he 
As for Twitter, the analytics firm Talkwalker noted a substantial lead in leave-related hashtags over remain-related hashtags 
Social media, by nature, is both a catalyst and a place for conversation. As such, the apparent dominance of pro-leave posts on Facebook and Instagram is neither a pure reflection of popular will nor a product of the services, but more likely something in between.
A full picture of voter sentiment on social media is visible only to the social media companies themselves. And the rate at which sharing and engaging on a social media platform translates into action is difficult to quantify.
Leave. EU left little up to chance. âSHARE IF YOU CARE,â it wrote in a post published two hours before the polls closed across Britain. âMake sure you vote NOW before itâs too late,â read a post an hour later.

More than 40 years ago, Alvin Toffler, a writer who had fashioned himself into one of the first futurists, warned that the accelerating pace of technological change would soon make us all sick. He called the sickness â
In Mr. Tofflerâs coinage, future shock wasnât simply a metaphor for our difficulties in dealing with new things. It was a real psychological malady, the âdizzying disorientation brought on by the premature arrival of the future.â And âunless intelligent steps are taken to combat it,â he warned, âmillions of human beings will find themselves increasingly disoriented, progressively incompetent to deal rationally with their environments.â
Mr. Toffler, who collaborated on âFuture Shockâ and many of his other books with his wife, Heidi, 
Yet in rereading Mr. Tofflerâs book, as I did last week, it seems clear that his diagnosis has largely panned out, with local and global crises arising daily from our collective inability to deal with ever-faster change.
All around, technology is altering the world: Social media is subsuming 
But even though these and 
Look at the news: Politics has become frustratingly small-minded and shortsighted. We arenât any better at recognizing threats and opportunities that we see emerging beyond the horizon of the next election. While roads, bridges, broadband networks and other vital pieces of infrastructure are breaking down, governments, especially ours, have become derelict at rebuilding things â âa near-total failure of our political institutions to invest for the future,â as 
In many large ways, itâs almost as if we have collectively stopped planning for the future. Instead, we all just sort of bounce along in the present, caught in the headlights of a tomorrow pushed by a few large corporations and shaped by the inescapable logic of hyper-efficiency â a future heading straight for us. Itâs not just future shock; we now have future blindness.
âI donât know of many people anymore whose day-to-day pursuit is the academic study of the future,â said 
It didnât have to come to this. In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, as the American government began to spend huge sums in the Cold War, futurists became the high priests of the coming age. Forecasting became institutionalized; research institutes like RAND, SRI and MITRE worked on long-range projections about technology, global politics and weaponry, and world leaders and businesses took their forecasts as seriously as news of the present day.
In 1972, the federal government even blessed the emerging field of futurism with a new research agency, the congressional Office of Technology Assessment, which reviewed proposed legislation for its long-term effects. Futurists were optimistic about lawmakersâ new interest in the long term.
âCongressmen and their staffs are searching for ways to make government more anticipatory,â Edward Cornish, president of the World Future Society, 
But since the 1980s, 
ââFuturistâ always sounded like this weird, made-up, science-fiction term,ââ Ms. Webb said, even though in its early years, people were doing deep, nuanced research on how various tech and social movements would shape the world.
Futurismâs reputation for hucksterism became self-fulfilling as people who called themselves futurists made and sold predictions about products, and went on the conference circuit to push them. Long-term thinking became associated with the sort of new-agey âthinkfluencersâ who hung out at TED and Davos, and who went by names like 
The end of the Cold War and a rise in partisan political interests also changed how lawmakers saw the utility of looking at the future. In the Reagan years, many on the right began to see the government as the cause of most of the nationâs ills. The idea that the government could do something as difficult as predict the future came to be considered a ridiculous waste of money.
Newt Gingrich has long been enamored of science fiction â he 
Of course, the future doesnât stop coming just because you stop planning for it. Technological change has only sped up since the 1990s. 
Yet without soliciting advice from a class of professionals charged with thinking systematically about the future, we risk rushing into tomorrow headlong, without a plan.
âIt is ridiculous that the United States is one of the only nations of our size and scope in the world that no longer has an office that is dedicated to rigorous, nonpartisan research about the future,â Ms. Webb said. âThe fact that we donât do that is insane.â
Or, as Mr. Toffler put it in âFuture Shock,â âChange is avalanching upon our heads and most people are grotesquely unprepared to cope with it.â

European leaders expressed alarm: Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said there would be economic consequences to an exit; Dalia Grybauskaite, the president of Lithuania, said âwe all need to wake up and smell the coffeeâ; and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium called Britainâs vote to withdraw âa wake-up alarm.â

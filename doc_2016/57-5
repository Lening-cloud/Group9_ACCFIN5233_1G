Like Mr. Parks, I am a British expatriate. I have lived outside Britain for more than 30 years, and I was not too surprised that England and Wales, but significantly, not Scotland, Northern Ireland or the young, voted to leave the European Union. But I cannot disagree more with him on his views of the E.U.
When Britain joined in 1973, the country was in political and economic decline. Britain had become insular and increasingly irrelevant. Joining the E.U. repositioned Britainâs place in the world as a critical player within the new European bloc and economically as a gateway to Europe.
A huge influx of overseas investment and human capital has been transformative. London has become the de facto capital of Europe, and English its lingua franca. Young people see themselves as Europeans.
The E.U., despite its problems, has become a family of nations. Britainâs leaving the European Union is a retrogressive step for all Europeans, including the English.

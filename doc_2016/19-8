PARIS â If Jonathan Anderson looked a little tired today, as he showed the media and buyers around his spring 2017 collection for Loewe, it was understandable. He said he had been up all night watching the returns of Britainâs âBrexitâ vote, 
And he was not happy. âA terrible day,â he said as he stood amid the new line of colorful shirts, handbags and shoes in the Loewe store on Rue Bonaparte, many of which he said had been influenced by family trips to Ibiza when he was younger. Mr. Anderson, like 
âItâs really sad,â he said of the victory for the âLeaveâ position. âI think itâs going to be a very big problem.â
He added that he slept a little after the vote was official, roughly as dawn was breaking in Paris, but he was awake again when David Cameron came out of 10 Downing Street to announce that he would be stepping down as prime minister later in the year. âHe had no choice,â Mr. Anderson said of the Conservative Party leader. âHe was the one who got the ball rolling on this.â
As for why the majority of Britons voted to quit the European Union, Mr. Anderson said he thought that âpeople were very confused about what they were voting for,â and he, along with many others this morning, blamed the British media â âon both sidesâ â for not doing a better job of explaining the actual issues at stake. âItâs a nightmare,â he added.
And then it was back to fashion. âI like the idea of going on an adventure,â Mr. Anderson said, gesturing around at the Ibiza-inspired collection and looking very much in need of a strong cup of coffee.

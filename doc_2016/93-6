What’s ahead for the American economy?
That question is dividing experts, given that the economy has advanced at a slow pace since last winter even as the job market has recorded impressive gains.
Well, we have some one-handed economists.
On the one hand, Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, sees growth picking up smartly in the third and fourth quarter, powered by a still-strong consumer and fading headwinds for the business sector. Indeed, he believes the Federal Reserve might well raise interest rates when policy makers meet next month.
On the other hand, Stephanie Pomboy, founder of MacroMavens, an independent economics consulting firm, thinks the optimists on Wall Street are in for another round of disappointment, with the economy once again failing to deliver a much-promised, but so far elusive, acceleration.
With the Labor Department scheduled to release the latest monthly jobs report on Friday, we talked with them last week about why they see things so differently.
Since policy makers can’t abide that slow growth, the onus will shift to the fiscal side and political leadership. Reducing the corporate tax rate, reducing the regulatory burden on companies and changing the tax code to incentivize corporations to hire and expand, rather than pay dividends and buy back stock, would certainly help growth in the long term.
That said, there’s a case to be made that more investment in education, more emphasis on retraining and retooling American workers, and more infrastructure spending would help. There are things that can be done and a well-calibrated public-sector investment plan would pay dividends in the long term.

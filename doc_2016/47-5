LONDON â David, 49, is not looking for love; he is seeking votes, especially from young Britons who are considered more likely to vote for Britain to remain inside the European Union in a coming referendum.
This David â Cameron, the prime minister of Britain â is not joining Tinder, a dating app, a Downing Street spokesman said on Tuesday, nor has he joined TheLADbible, a popular photo and video site for men 16 to 30. But the prime ministerâs office did say it is exploring advertising on both services, and looking for other hip ways to get more young people to register and to vote.

Britons are used to Mr. Johnsonâs extravagant language, but the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, on Tuesday 
âWhen I hear the E.U. being compared to the plans and projects of Adolf Hitler, I cannot remain silent,â he said. âSuch absurd arguments should be completely ignored if they had not been formulated by one of the most influential politicians in the ruling party.â
Mr. Johnson âcrossed the boundaries of rational discourse, demonstrating political amnesia,â Mr. Tusk said.
But Britons on Tuesday seemed most exercised by the news that the BBC, seeking budget cuts, will ax a

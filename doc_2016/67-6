I missed half of this week because I was super sick, but it seems like I didnât miss much. Most of the worldâs news was more geopolitical and less, uh, technopolitical.
Hereâs one thing: Twitter bought an artificial intelligence start-up 
Itâs VidCon and Cannes Lions, big advertising industry events in our world, so a bunch of tech companies announced metrics and small ad-related product updates. Instagram hit 
Also: I liked BuzzFeedâs investigation into Uberâs pay. For years the ride-hailing company has been talking up how much its drivers make, but drivers have long complained that Uberâs declining fares lead to very low wages. 
Also, Twilio debuted on the 
My gut reaction: pure and utter contempt. Iâm seriously considering switching to Android, thatâs how annoying this is to me. O.K., now you go and tell me why Apple would do this. It seems like a real strong way to alienate users.
So basically it looks like the new iPhone will be roughly the same phone we have now, with one major thing missing. What is Apple thinking? We wonât know exactly until it releases the new phone later this year, but this seems bad to me. Sales of the iPhone are already flat. The company needed something big this year. Now itâs creating a device that many might consider a downgrade rather than an upgrade.
Yeah, sure, but that argument doesnât really hold for the audio jack, because it is basically perfect in its current state, and honestly I canât see any reason for upgrading. As you point out, todayâs headphone jack works on just about every device you have (including airplanes). One based on Appleâs proprietary Lightning connector will work only on iOS devices and not anywhere else â not even current Macs, which lack a Lightning port. So guess what? Youâll need to get a little adapter, or dongle, to carry with you all the time. And what about wireless headphones? Well, those work on todayâs iPhones, and getting rid of the headphone jack doesnât somehow make them better.

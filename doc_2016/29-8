On Thursday, Britain votes on whether to leave the European Union. Two of The Upshotâs financial reporters, Neil Irwin and Peter Eavis, discussed the potential consequences of what is being called Brexit.
The funny thing about Brexit and markets is the gap between the polling evidence, which has decisively swung in the last couple of weeks toward Britain leaving the E.U., and the comparative equanimity of financial markets. Yes, the pound is down since late May, from around $1.47 to $1.42. British stocks are down. British government bond yields are down substantially as well, though that could cut either way in what itâs telling us. But none of this is panic-alarm type of activity in financial markets of the sort we saw surrounding the more intense phases of the Greek crisis. The way I see it, there are two possibilities: Either markets think British voters will come to their senses by Election Day and the polling should be ignored, or investors just think the financial and economic ripples of a âleaveâ vote are overstated.
But Iâm not sure which theory I place more weight on.
Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed âBrexit.â

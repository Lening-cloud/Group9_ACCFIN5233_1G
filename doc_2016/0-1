The truncated visit by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain 
Mrs. May came to Brussels evidently intent on demonstrating that Britain is still an active member, and indeed she joined in all the critical discussions on Syria, Russia and other contentious issues. But when time came for the dinner at which Brexit was to be discussed, there was no place set for Britain.
And when the other 27 members did come around to talking Brexit, they spent all of 20 minutes on it, reaffirming that Britain cannot pick and choose what parts of membership it wants to keep or jettison and confirming Michel Barnier, a former French foreign minister, as the chief negotiator for the European Union.
The Union’s sang froid was in sharp contrast to the fierce debate in Britain over how to proceed. Mrs. May has insisted that “Brexit means Brexit” and that she will invoke Article 50 — the Union’s rules that, once triggered, set a two-year deadline for completion — by the end of March.
But a whole vocabulary has developed over what that might mean — a “hard Brexit” or a “gray Brexit” or, if there is no deal, a “cliff edge,” instantly severing Britain from the European Union’s tariff-free trade and single market. Mrs. May says she will not provide Parliament with details on her plans until late February. In another element of suspense, Britain’s Supreme Court is to rule, probably in January, on whether the government can dissolve treaties with the Union on its own, or a vote of the full Parliament is needed.
It’s clear that the two-year deadline is woefully insufficient to untangle the web of laws that bind Britain to the union. The 
The May government is doing no one any good by keeping a foolish illusion alive — that Britain can keep the economic benefits of membership, while opting out of things it doesn’t like, notably freedom of movement for citizens of member countries. The sooner Mrs. May spells out how she will proceed, the better for her countrymen, and Europe, too.

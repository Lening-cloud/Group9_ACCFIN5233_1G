TWENTY years ago, when New Yorkers asked me where I was from, all Iâd say is that I grew up in Britain. Mentioning that I was born in Bangladesh drew only more questions, and New Yorkers simply wanted confirmation of what was to them the distinctive cultural marker: my British accent.
That accent was learned from imitating BBC News announcers on a cassette recorder. As a boy, I read about the destruction of millions of Jews and was gripped by fear: If white Europeans could do that to people who looked like them, imagine what they could do to me.
So I adapted, hoping to make myself less alien to these people so ill at ease with difference. I grew up not so long ago in a Britain that spat at nonwhites, beat us and daubed swastikas on walls.
Britain frightens its natives with the specter of a fifth column, and exhorts immigrants to integrate better and adopt British values. Do it and youâll earn your stripes. But the promise is hollow, for Britain has no intention of keeping its side of the bargain.
Recently, I was invited onto the judging panel for the 
The 
The Man Booker Prize administration released a statement congratulating Mr. Stothard, a former judge of its award, and 
I have no idea what citizenships my fellow panelists hold; unhelpfully, Man Booker did not provide that information. I was, however, surprised to learn that Iâm Bangladeshi. I donât have a Bangladeshi passport, though I do hold a British one. In fact, Iâve lawfully held two valid British passports (to facilitate travel to so-called incompatible countries, like Israel and Jordan).
Clearly, holding two British passports doesnât make me doubly British. But surely, for a bastion of the British establishment to call me Bangladeshi, it should have sufficient reason to believe that I am precisely that. Shall we put the error down to mere ignorance of the fact that millions of British citizens were born in, or are descendants of people born in, the post-colonies? Of course, keeping me Bangladeshi has the advantage of enabling some people to tell me to go back to my own country.
We invite you to share your experiences âconfronting issues of race in your life.
The issue is not what I choose to call myself but what the supposedly educated Briton chooses to call nonwhite British citizens. Britain has a problem with otherness.
This problem is not exclusively a British one. Although the âBrexitâ campaign over a referendum to determine Britainâs exit from the European Union has revealed a nasty undercurrent of hostility toward other Europeans, the British do share something with the Continent.
I recently appeared on âBuitenhof,â a political program on Dutch television, to 
I have been cosseted in Amsterdam for several months, where I am a writer in residence at the university and my novel is a national best seller. Last month, I attended the annual Boekenbal, a gala celebrating Dutch publishing, the main purpose of which, I learned, is to generate gossip about who is deemed worthy of tickets. In other words, its function is to establish an inside group.
My publisher invited me to a dinner before the gala at a restaurant. Midway through, I remembered my coat: On arrival, Iâd left it somewhere and forgotten about it. When eventually a member of the staff and I found it, valuables still present, I thanked him.
âIt is a pleasure to have you here,â he replied. Slightly odd formulation, I thought, putting it down to translation.
âNo, sir,â he added, lowering his voice, âI mean it is an honor to have you here.â I looked at the man again.
âI saw you on âBuitenhofâ last week, and everything you said was right. But the Dutch wonât understand it because they canât see it.â
âWhatâs your name?â I asked.
âEmile,â he said, shaking my hand. âItâs the name I use at work. My parents are Egyptian, but I was born in the Netherlands. Iâm the sommelier here and I know everything there is to know about wine.
âI speak Dutch fluently,â he went on, in English. âI know more about Dutch culture than most Dutch people. I am Dutch, but Iâm never really accepted as Dutch.â
The encounter moved me, and I stepped out into the cold Amsterdam night to recover my composure.
These days, when New Yorkers ask me where Iâm from, sometimes I might say, for the hell of it, âI was born in Bangladesh.â Unfailingly, itâs not enough. Often, bless âem, they say, âYeah, but youâre British, right?â I have to cross the Atlantic to hear this.
Iâve learned to cope. But when I think of the children in the projects where I grew up, and in the underprivileged school in Londonâs East End where I sat on the board, I know that taking refuge in the novelistâs seclusion would be an abrogation.
Every battle of ideas is fought on the terrain of language. To the white Briton, the hyphenated identity â Bangladeshi-British, Pakistani-British â only highlights otherness. Each side regards the hyphenated identity as a concession to the other, rather than both rejoicing in a new stripe in a rainbow nation.
It does not come easily for white Britons to speak, face to face, of a nonwhite Britonâs nationality. The shuffling feet, the throat-clearing, the unmet eye give it away. Hyphenation sounds clunky, feels awkward; even calling someone just British is less pointed, less charged. The British have history; the Bangladeshi-British have punctuation.
It is Britainâs inherent cultural problem with otherness that makes it difficult for the native to call me British, difficult even for those who, one might naÃ¯vely hope, should know better.
If youâre not going to call me British when I grew up in Britain; when I hold a British passport and donât hold a Bangladeshi one; when I donât even speak Bengali; when, good citizen that I try to be, I help an elderly neighbor with his Ikea bed, or dig out the old lilac that another cannot uproot; when I was educated in Britain, worked in Britain, was â
After all, how much more can I integrate? What more is it you want from us? To be white? To be you?

WASHINGTON â In the days since Britons voted to leave the European Union, the so-called âBrexitâ referendum has created such severe turmoil that public attention is increasingly focused on an extreme option: Can they get out of it?
Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday that he considered the referendum binding and that âthe process of implementing the decision in the best possible way must now begin.â But he also said he would 
If the next prime minister does trigger the departure process, Britain then has two years to negotiate the terms of its leaving. While European Union rules say that membership is revoked automatically at the end of that period, Britain could theoretically use that time to negotiate an alternative plan.
The country has a few options for how, during these two windows, it might remain in the European Union. Each carries significant risks and downsides, both for Europe and for Britain itself â but, then again, so does leaving.
The referendum is not legally binding. The process of leaving does not begin until the prime minister officially invokes 
Mr. Cameron has already caused a delay by refusing to invoke Article 50 himself. Of his two most likely possible successors in the Conservative Party, Theresa May opposes leaving the union and Boris Johnson, a prime Brexit proponent, is already 
Most members of Parliament opposed leaving the union, and might support a prime minister who refused to invoke Article 50. But that would be akin to overruling the will of 17.4 million Britons who voted to leave, an extreme step in a country that prides itself on democratic values.
It would also risk inflaming the underlying political forces that led to the âLeaveâ victory: rising populist anger, distrust of seemingly unaccountable government institutions and a belief that the system is rigged.
It is difficult to predict how pro-Brexit voters would respond if their government ignored the referendumâs result, but such a move risks empowering more extreme voices. British politics, already in tremendous turmoil, would face an uncertain future, as would the lawmakers who will be up for re-election.

This offers at least a hint more political legitimacy than simply disregarding the referendum.
But if Britainâs next prime minister is intent on following through with Brexit, the British Parliament could repeal the law that gives Scotland veto power. Ms. Sturgeon would probably respond by seeking a new referendum on Scottish independence â something she has already threatened to do if Britain leaves the union.
In 1992, Danish voters narrowly rejected a referendum on joining one of the treaties that laid the European Unionâs foundations. Eleven months later, after a flurry of diplomacy, Denmark held a second referendum, which voters approved.
Similar scenarios unfolded in 2001 â and again in 2008 â when Irish voters rejected European Union treaties before embracing them in second referendums in subsequent years.
Could British voters reverse themselves as well? By Monday, four days after the Brexit vote, an 
But there is little reason to believe that a second referendum, were it held today, would yield a different result. While a handful of Britons have said on social media that they regretted their vote to leave the union, polling suggests that they are a tiny minority. A 
British leaders could justify a second cut at the question by securing special concessions from the European Union, like allowing Britain to put a cap on immigration. This approach was how Danish and Irish leaders persuaded their voters to approve the referendums they had previously rejected.
Mr. Johnson, who said on Monday that Britain was âpart of Europe and always will be,â hinted before the vote that he might pursue this strategy. âThere is only one way to get the change we need, and that is to vote to go,â he 
A second vote would allow politicians to claim that they had followed the will of the voters and stood up to the European Union, avoiding both populist outrage and the economic and diplomatic fallout of a British exit.
European leaders, however, may not be eager to go along. If any member state can extract special concessions by threatening to leave, it undermines the unionâs ability to make Europe-wide policies. It also gives other states an incentive to play chicken with exit referendums, a dangerous game that could easily end in disaster.
There is also a risk that British voters would reject the second referendum as well. If that happened, there would truly be no going back.
Article 50 gives an exiting country two years to negotiate terms for its relationship with the union, on issues like trade and migration.
What if Britain struck a series of deals that largely preserved the status quo, only without formal European Union membership?
This, too, seems to be something Mr. Johnson is pondering. In an

One model is Norway, which is not a European Union member but subscribes to its common market and open borders.
âLeaveâ campaigners emphasized two goals: reducing migration and extracting Britain from European bureaucracy. While a Norway-style arrangement could, in theory, limit migration, it would worsen British subjugation to European policy makers.
If Britain chose this path, it âwould have no vote and no presence when crucial decisions that affect the daily lives of its citizens are made,â Norwayâs former foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide,

These leaders, he said, want to send a âclear and unambiguousâ message to other member states: If you leave the union, you will not be rewarded with a sweetheart deal allowing you the benefits of membership without the burden. You will get a hard and painful breakup, so think carefully.

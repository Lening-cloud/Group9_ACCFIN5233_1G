His defenders argue that for all of his verbal daggers, Mr. Johnson is at heart a liberal internationalist.

As Londonâs mayor â from 2008 until May of this year â Mr. Johnson proved to be both popular and canny, presiding over a successful Olympic Games in 2012, improving public transportation (the cityâs shared-cycling program is still informally known as âBoris Bikesâ) and traveling the world to raise the cityâs profile as a capital of commerce and finance.
Here, however, are some of Mr. Johnsonâs memorable utterances that may shadow him in his new role as Britainâs top diplomat.

âWell I think Donald Trump is clearly out of his mind if he thinks that is an acceptable and sensible way to proceed. You canât ban people going to the United States in that way, or indeed to any country.â

(SOUNDBITE) (English) LONDON MAYOR, BORIS JOHNSON, SAYING:

âI would invite him to come and see the whole of London and take him round the city, except I wouldnât want to expose Londoners to any unecessary risk of meeting Donald Trump.â

(SOUNDBITE) (English) LONDON MAYOR, BORIS JOHNSON, SAYING:

âI certainly think that he is out of his mind if he thinks that there are parts of London that are too dangerous to go to. As I say I think it portrays an ignorance that is truly alarming in a candidate that has got that far in the race to be president of the United States.â
Asked about a proposal by Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to bar Muslims from entering the United States, Mr. Johnson responded that Mr. Trump was â

(SOUNDBITE) (English) FORMER MAYOR OF LONDON, BORIS JOHNSON, SAYING:
âAs I say - you persist in trying to drag the subject back to previous attempts to unify Europe. What Iâm talking about is what is going on now and it is deeply, anti-democratic.â

Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said Mr. Johnson had âcrossed the boundaries of rational discourse.â But Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative lawmaker, defended the remarks as âabsolutely true.â While Hitler and Napoleon wanted to create a single European power through violence, he said, âthe E.U. is trying to do it by stealth.â

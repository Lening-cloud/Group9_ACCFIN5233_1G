Italiansâ rejection of a reformist leader underlined worries about the countryâs commitment to the euro, as well as its banking system, which holds 360 billion euros, or about $385 billion, in suspect debt.
Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a troubled lender, was set to receive â¬5 billion from private investors. Now, because of the political upheaval, senior bankers have told the bank to prepare for a state bailout,

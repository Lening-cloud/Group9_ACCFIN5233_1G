Spain has effectively been without a government for eight months now, its politicians unable to form a majority in Parliament after two inconclusive elections. Curiously, the economy has not suffered — Spain’s credit rating is healthy and the stock market has withstood Brexit better than much of the rest of Europe. That may be great fodder for jokes about the uselessness of politicians, but no country can remain in political limbo for long without risk. Among other challenges that require serious attention from Madrid is the separatist drive in Catalonia. There is also too much turmoil in the European Union for Spain to sit on the sidelines.
This week, Mariano Rajoy, leader of the conservative Peoples’ Party and the caretaker prime minister, 
He’ll get that majority if enough Socialists abstain, which they should. There’s little chance they would improve their position in December. Further, even under a minority government, the Socialists would have considerable say in any legislation or reform.
Abstaining won’t be easy for the Socialist leader, Pedro Sánchez. The alternative, however, is four more months of interim government, which means no budgets, no new ministers and most likely no legislation.
A minority coalition government involving factions as hostile as the Socialists and the far-left Podemos hardly promises effective government. But a messy government is better than no government, and at least Spanish voters have not followed other Europeans who have lurched to the far right in their uncertainty and fears.
The political deadlock in Spain was created by voters’ demanding better and more honest government. Both Mr. Rajoy (should he get the chance to form a real government) and Mr. Sánchez (should he allow it), as leaders of the two parties that bore the brunt of voter dissatisfaction, must understand that the way out of the gridlock is to demonstrate that they have heard the message.

One defining characteristic of recent political debate â in the United States and abroad â is anxiety about foreigners.
You see it in Donald Trumpâs railing against immigrants and trade agreements. It may well be part of Hillary Clintonâs shift, under pressure from Bernie Sanders, against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she once embraced as âthe 
You certainly see it in the British decision to exit the European Union, which has become known as Brexit. That vote flummoxed most political forecasters, and it makes one wonder whether Americans might also produce a surprise in November.
Whatâs going on?
Voters clearly arenât listening to economists. In a 
Similarly, in the United States, most top economists 
In one respect, it is easy to understand why. According to a CBS News/New York Times 
But all this raises the question of why so many people, on both sides of the Atlantic, are ready to embrace a move away from international economic engagement when expert opinion overwhelmingly calls for a very different approach. Economists do not have a good answer, but some political scientists have been studying the issue.
In particular, Edward Mansfield and Diana Mutz, professors in the political science department of the University of Pennsylvania, have written a pair of research papers exploring attitudes toward 
For an economist, one natural hypothesis to entertain is that peopleâs attitudes toward globalization are based on their self-interest. That is because textbook economic theory says that openness to international trade increases a nationâs overall prosperity, but it also says that some people gain and others lose. Even if the gains exceed the losses over all, those who get the short end of the stick may still object.
Yet Mr. Mansfield and Ms. Mutz reject this theory of voter attitude. If people were just looking out for themselves, their view of globalization would be determined by the industry in which they worked. Those in industries with a high concentration of exports should be favorable to an open economy, while those in industries that have to compete with imports should be opposed. In actuality, however, peopleâs attitudes about free trade and offshore outsourcing are unrelated to the characteristics of the industry in which they are employed.
After analyzing their survey data on individualsâ attitudes and attributes, these political scientists conclude that voters embrace policies based on the broader national interest. This theory is called sociotropic voting. There are several reasons people may look beyond narrow self-interest.
One is simply that people are more altruistic than economists usually think they are. But itâs also possible that it is just hard for people to determine with much precision how national policies affect their personal circumstances, and in light of this uncertainty, it is reasonable to presume that any policy good for the overall economy is probably good for you, too.
The issue then becomes why people think that globalization is bad for the economy in the first place. In other words, why do they doubt what so many economists teach about the gains from trade? The data analysis of Mr. Mansfield and Ms. Mutz suggests that skepticism about trade and outsourcing is closely related to three other sets of beliefs.
The first is isolationism more broadly. Trade skeptics tend to think, for example, that the United States should stay out of world affairs and avoid getting involved in foreign conflicts. They are not eager for the United States to work with other nations to solve global problems like hunger and pollution.
The second is nationalism. Trade skeptics tend to think that the United States is culturally superior to other nations. They say the world would be better if people elsewhere were more like Americans.
The third is ethnocentrism. Trade skeptics tend to divide the world into racial and ethnic groups and think that the one they belong to is better than the others. They say their own group is harder-working, less wasteful and more trustworthy.
As Mr. Mansfield and Ms. Mutz put it, âtrade preferences are driven less by economic considerations and more by an individualâs psychological worldview.â They also report that this isolationist, nationalist, ethnocentric worldview is related to oneâs level of education. The more years of schooling people have, the more likely they are to reject anti-globalization attitudes.
Consistent with this, 
In the long run, therefore, there is reason for optimism. As society slowly becomes more educated from generation to generation, the general publicâs attitudes toward globalization should move toward the expertsâ.
The short run in which we find ourselves now, however, is another story.

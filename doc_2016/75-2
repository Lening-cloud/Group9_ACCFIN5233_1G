âPost-truthâ has been named Oxford Dictionariesâ 2016 international 
The use of âpost-truthâ â defined as ârelating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal beliefâ â increased by 2,000 percent over last year, according to analysis of the Oxford English Corpus, which collects roughly 150 million words of spoken and written English from various sources each month.
Katherine Connor Martin, the head of United States dictionaries at Oxford University Press, said it surged most sharply in June after the Brexit vote and Donald J. Trumpâs securing the Republican nomination for president, making it an unusually global word.
âWhat we found especially interesting is that it encapsulated a trans-Atlantic phenomenon,â she said. âOften, when looking at words, youâll find one thatâs a really big deal in the U.K. but not in the U.S.â
The term, whose first known usage in this particular sense was in a 1992 essay in The Nation magazine citing the Iran-contra scandal and the Persian Gulf War, does not represent an entirely new concept.

Ms. Martin said that Oxfordâs definition â âan ideological grouping associated with extreme conservative or reactionary viewpoints, characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics and by the use of online media to disseminate deliberately controversial contentâ â was a particularly difficult one to research and write.
In general, she said, it is not used as a âsimple synonymâ for white supremacy, though some who embrace the term do openly acknowledge its usefulness in softening and selling extreme ideas.

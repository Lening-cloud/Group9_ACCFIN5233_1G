Jack London’s classic “The Call of the Wild,” published in 1903, imagined the harsh life of a dog. But London also witnessed human suffering close to home and on travels throughout the world, chronicling them in his famous words and in less famous but remarkable photographs.
In 2010, a coffee-table collection (“Jack London: Photographer”) coincided with an exhibition of the author’s visual work. Now, “The Paths Men Take,” being published this week by Contrasto, offers select photos alongside excerpts from the essays and reportage that originally accompanied them.
For “The People of the Abyss,” London moved among the destitute in the city of London’s East End: men lining up for a free breakfast, some looking defiant and others defeated; drunken women fighting next to a line of drying clothes. “No other work of mine contains as much of my heart and my youthful tears as that study on the degradation of the poor,” he said.
In his native San Francisco, London saw the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake that devastated the city. “What use is trying?” he said when asked to write about it. “One can only put together a whole load of words and be frustrated at their futility.” But London did write about the event for Collier’s magazine. His own stunning photos ran with the piece, in which he described walking through downtown after the quake — but before the ensuing fires had engulfed the city. “Here was no fire. All was in perfect order,” he wrote. “And yet it was doomed, all of it. There was no water. . . . And at right angles two different conflagrations were sweeping down upon it.”

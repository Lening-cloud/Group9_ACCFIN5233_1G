LONDON â Freed from the shackles of the European Union, Britainâs economy would prosper and its security would increase. Britain would âtake back controlâ of immigration, reducing the number of arrivals. And it would be able to spend about 350 million pounds, or about $470 million, a week more on health care instead of sending the money to Brussels.
Before Thursdayâs referendum on the countryâs membership in the 28-nation bloc, campaigners for British withdrawal, known as Brexit, tossed out promises of a better future while dismissing concerns raised by a host of scholars and experts as âProject Fear.â
But that was before they won.
With financial markets in turmoil, a big drop in the pound and the prospect of further chaos, some supporters of Brexit are backpedaling on bold pronouncements they made just a few days earlier. âA lot of things were said in advance of this referendum that we might want to think about again,â Liam Fox, a former cabinet minister, told the BBC, including when and how Article 50 â the

Promises to quickly reduce immigration levels are also being played down. Migration was the cornerstone of the Leave campaign, which objected to the European Unionâs insistence on the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. Since 2004, when 10 more countries joined the European Union, large numbers of eastern and southern Europeans have moved to Britain for work.
Mr. Johnson argued that it was impossible for the government to reduce immigration while in the European Union. His ally Michael Gove, the justice secretary, said a leave vote would âbring down the numbersâ by 2020. Experts have long said that would be very hard to pull off. The European Union has demanded from nonmember states â Norway, for example â free movement of workers in exchange for access to the blocâs single market.
On Friday, the day after the referendum, Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament and one of the most knowledgeable advocates of Brexit, stunned some viewers of the BBC by saying: âFrankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the E.U., they are going to be disappointed.â

Having now ousted Prime Minister David Cameron, they face a political vacuum, with their base demanding that promises be kept. Mr. Johnson, the front-runner to replace Mr. Cameron, has not made any further pronouncements since a subdued statement on Friday that was restricted to generalities. If he does become prime minister, Mr. Johnson will face the task of carrying out a British withdrawal without provoking a backlash from those who believed campaign slogans or sentiments that he certainly appeared to endorse.
âIn voting to leave the E.U., it is vital to stress that there is now no need for haste,â Mr. Johnson told reporters. Standing alongside him, Mr. Gove promised, âWe can have democratic consent for an immigration policy that is fairer and more humane.â He did not explain how.
